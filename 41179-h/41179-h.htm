<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The little portage pathways which connected
the heads of our rivers and
lakes or offered the <i>voyageur</i> a thoroughfare
around the cataracts and rapids
of our rivers were, as the subtitle of this
volume suggests, the &ldquo;Keys of the Continent&rdquo;
a century or so ago. The forts,
chapels, trading stations, treaty houses,
council fires, boundary stones, camp grounds,
and villages located at these strategic points
all prove this. The study of these routes
brings one at once face to face with old-time
problems from a point of view almost
never otherwise gained. The newness and
value of reviewing historic movements from
the standpoint of highways is strikingly
emphasized in the case of portage paths.
While studying them, one seems to rise on
heights of ground like those these pathways
spanned&mdash;and from that altitude, gazing
backward, to get a better perspective of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
military and social movements which made
these little roads historic.</p>

<p>The difficulty of treating such a broad
subject in a single monograph must be
apparent. Portages are found wherever
lakes or rivers lie, and our subject is therefore
as broad as the continent. It is obvious
that in a limited space it is possible to
treat only of portages most used and best
known&mdash;which most influenced our history.
These are practically included in the territory
lying south of the Great Lakes between
the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi
River. Historically, too, we are taken
back to the early days of our history when
America was coextensive with the continent,
for the important portages were those
binding the St. Lawrence with the rivers
of New England, and the tributaries of the
Great Lakes with those of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>It has seemed most profitable to divide
the subject into two parts: in the first,
under the specific title of &ldquo;Portage Paths&rdquo;
is given a description of these routes, their
nature, use, and evolution. The second
part is devoted to a &ldquo;Catalogue of American
Portages,&rdquo; and in it are included<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
extracts from the studies of students who
have given the subject of portages their
attention, showing style of treatment, methods
of investigation and research, and
results of field-work. Among these Dr.
Wm. F. Ganong&rsquo;s <i>Historic Sites in the Province
of New Brunswick</i> and Elbert J. Benton&rsquo;s
<i>The Wabash Trade Route</i> are commanding
examples of critical, scholarly field-work
and specific historical analysis. Professor
Justin H. Smith&rsquo;s impressive monograph on
<i>Arnold&rsquo;s Battle with the Wilderness</i>, and
Secretary George A. Baker&rsquo;s <i>The St. Joseph-Kankakee
Portage</i> are illustrations of what
could and should be done in many score
of cases throughout the United States. To
Sylvester&rsquo;s <i>Northern New York</i> and Dr. H. C.
Taylor&rsquo;s <i>The Old Portage Road</i> the author is
likewise indebted. The author has attempted
to make good in some degree the
astonishing lack of material concerning the
famous Oneida Portage in New York, a
subject which calls loudly for earnest and
minute study&mdash;for this portage path at
Rome, New York, with the exception of
Niagara, was the most important west of
the Hudson River. A plea for the study<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
of the subject of portages and the marking
of historic sites occupies the concluding
pages.</p>

<h3>NATURE AND USE OF PORTAGES</h3>

<p>There may be no better way to introduce
the subject of the famous old
portages of America, than to ask the
reader to walk, in fancy, along what may
be called a &ldquo;Backbone of America&rdquo;&mdash;that
watershed which runs from the North
Atlantic seaboard to the valley of the Mississippi
River. It will prove a long, rough,
circuitous journey, but at the end the traveler
will realize the meaning of the word
&ldquo;portage,&rdquo; which in our day has almost
been forgotten in common parlance, and
will understand what it meant in the long
ago, when old men dreamed dreams and
young men saw visions which will never be
dreamed or seen again in human history.
As we start westward from New Brunswick
and until we reach the sweeping tides of
the Mississippi we shall see, on the right
hand and on the left, the gleaming lakes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
or half-hidden brooks and rivulets which
flow northward to the St. Lawrence or the
Great Lakes, or southward to the Atlantic
Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. On the high
ground between the heads of these water-courses
our path lies.</p>

<p>For the greater portion of our journey
we shall find neither road nor pathway;
here we shall climb and follow long, ragged
mountain crests, well nigh inaccessible, in
some spots never trod by human foot save
the wandering hunter&rsquo;s;  there we shall
drop down to a lower level and find that on
our watershed run roads, canals, and railways.
At many points in our journey we
shall find a perfect network of modern
routes of travel, converging perhaps on a
teeming city which owes its growth and
prosperity to its geographical situation at
a strategic point on the watershed we are
following. And where we find the largest
population and the greatest activity today,
just there, we may rest assured, human
activity was equally noticeable in the old
days.</p>

<p>As we pass along we must bear in mind
the story of days gone by, as well as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
geography which so much influenced it.
It is to the earliest days of our country&rsquo;s
history that our attention is attracted&mdash;to
the days when the French came to the St.
Lawrence and the Great Lakes, and sought
to know and possess the interior of the continent,
to which each shining tributary of
the northern water system offered a passage
way. Passing the question how and why
New France was founded on the St. Lawrence,
it is enough for us to know she was
there before the seventeenth century
dawned, and that her fearless <i>voyageurs</i>,
undaunted by the rushing tides of that
great stream, were pushing on to a conquest
of the temperate empire which lay to the
southward. Here in treacherous eddies,
the foaming rapids, and the mighty current
of that river, they were soon taught the
woodland art of canoeing, by the most savage
of masters; and in canoes the traders,
trappers, missionaries, explorers, hunters,
and pioneers were soon stemming the current
of every stream that flowed from the
south.</p>

<p>But these streams found their sources in
this highland we are treading. Heedless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the interruption, these daring men
pushed their canoes to the uttermost navigable
limit, and then shouldered them and
crossed the watershed. Once over the &ldquo;portage,&rdquo;
and their canoes safely launched,
nothing stood between them and the Atlantic
Ocean. It is these portage paths for
which we shall look as we proceed westward.
As we pass, one by one, these slight roadways
across the backbone of the continent,
whether they be miles in length or only
rods, they must speak to us as almost
nothing else can, today, of the thousand
dreams of conquest entertained by the first
Europeans who traversed them, of the
thousand hopes that were rising of a New
France richer and more glorious than the
old.</p>

<p>Advancing westward from the northern
Atlantic we find ourselves at once between
the headwaters of the St. John River on
the south and sparkling Etchemin on the
north, and we cross the slight track which
joins these important streams. Not many
miles on we find ourselves between the Kennebec
on the south and the Chaudi&egrave;re on
the north, and cross the pathway between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
them which has been traversed by tens of
thousands until even the passes in the
rocks are worn smooth. The valley of the
Richelieu heads off the watershed and
turns it southwest; we accordingly pass
down the Green Mountain range, across
the historic path from Otter Creek to the
Connecticut, and below Lake George we
pass northward across the famous road from
the extremity of that lake to the Hudson.
Striking northward now we head the Hudson
in the Adirondacks and come down
upon the strategic watershed between its
principal tributary, the Mohawk, and Lake
Ontario. The watershed dodges between
Wood Creek, which flows northward, and
the Mohawk, at Rome, New York, where
Fort Stanwix guarded the portage path
between these streams. Pressing westward
below Seneca Lake and the Genessee,
our course takes us north of Lake Chautauqua,
where we cross the path over which
canoes were borne from Lake Erie to Lake
Chautauqua, and, a few miles westward,
we cross the portage path from Lake Erie
to Rivi&egrave;re aux B&#339;ufs, a tributary of the
Allegheny. Pursuing the height of land<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
westward we skirt the winding valley of
the Cuyahoga and at Akron, Ohio, find
ourselves crossing the portage between that
stream and the Tuscarawas branch of the
Muskingum. As we go on, the valley of
the Sandusky turns up southward until we
pass between its headwaters and just north
of the Olentangy branch of the Scioto.</p>

<p>We face north again and look over the
low-lying region of the Black Swamp until
the Maumee Valley bars our way and we
turn south to cross the historic portage
near Fort Wayne, Indiana, which connects
the Maumee and the Wabash. By a zig-zag
course we approach the basin of Lake
Michigan and pass deftly on the height of
ground between the St. Joseph flowing
northward and the Kankakee flowing southward.
Here we cross another famous
portage path. Circling the extremity of
Lake Michigan by a wide margin, our course
leads us to a passage way between the
Chicago River and the Illinois. Here we
find another path. The Wisconsin River
basin turns us northward now, and near
Madison, Wisconsin, we run between the
head of the Fox and the head of the Wis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>consin
and cross the famed portage path
which connected them. Just beyond lies
the Mississippi, and if we should wish to
avoid it we would be compelled to bear far
north among the Canadian lakes.</p>

<p>Thus from the Atlantic coast we have
passed to the Mississippi without crossing
one single stream of water; but we have
crossed at least twelve famous pathways
between streams that flow north and
south&mdash;routes of travel, which, when
studied, give us an insight into the story of
days long passed which cannot be gained
in any other way. Over these paths pushed
the first explorers, the men who, first of
Europeans, saw the Ohio and Mississippi.
Possessing a better knowledge of their
routes and their experiences while voyaging
in an unknown land, we realize better the
impetuosity of their ambition and the
meaning of their discoveries to them. We
can almost see them hurrying with uplifted
eyes over these little paths, tortured by the
luring suggestions of the glimmering waterways
in the distance. Whether it is that
bravest of brave men, La Salle, crossing
from Lake Erie to the Allegheny, or Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>quette
striding over the little path to the
stream which should carry him to the
Mississippi, or C&eacute;loron bearing the leaden
plates which were to claim the Ohio for
France up the difficult path from Lake Erie
to Lake Chautauqua, there is no moment
in these heroes&rsquo; lives more interesting than
this. These paths crossed the dividing
line between what was known and what
was unknown. Here on the high ground,
with eyes intent upon the vista below, faint
hearts were fired to greater exertions, and
dreamers heavy under the dead weight of
physical exhaustion again grew hopeful at
the camping place on the portage path.</p>

<p>Of all whose ambitions led them over
these little paths, none appeal more strongly
to us than the daring, patient missionaries
who here wore out their lives for the Master.
Each portage was known to them,
better, perhaps, than to any other class of
men. Here they encamped on their pilgrimages,
though, from being spots of
vantage which excited them onward, they
were rather the line of demarcation between
the near and the distant fields of service,
and all of them full of trial and suffering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and seeming defeat. Nowhere in the
North can the heroism of the Catholic missionaries
be more plainly read today in any
material objects than in the deep-worn,
half-forgotten portage paths which lay
along their routes. The nobility of their
ambitions, compared with those of explorers,
traders, and military and civil officials,
has ever been conspicuous, but the full
measure of their self-sacrifice cannot be
realized until we know better the intense
physical suffering they here endured. If
the study of portage paths results only in
a deeper appreciation of the bravery of
these black-robed fathers, it will be worth
far more than its cost.</p>

<p>In this connection it is proper to make a
restriction; portage paths not only joined
the heads of streams flowing in opposite
directions, but were also land routes
between rivers and lakes, between lakes,
and even between rivers running in the
same direction. They not only connected
the Etchemin and St. John, and the Chaudi&egrave;re
and Kennebec, but also the St. John
and the Kennebec, and the Kennebec and
Penobscot. Many portages joined the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
lesser lakes; for example, such as Lake
Simcoe, lying between Lake Ontario and
Georgian Bay, or Lake Chautauqua lying
between Lake Erie and the Allegheny
River. The most common form of portage,
however, was the pathway on a river&rsquo;s bank
around rapids and waterfalls which impeded
the <i>voyageur&rsquo;s</i> way. These were
very important on such a turbulent river as
the St. Lawrence, and on smaller rivers
such as the Scioto or Rivi&egrave;re aux B&#339;ufs
which were almost dry in certain places in
midsummer.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In midwinter, with ice running
or blocking the course on small
streams, these carrying places were as important
as in the dry season.</p>

<p>The clearest pictures preserved for us of
travelers on these first highways are, happily,
to be found in the letters of the Jesuit
missionaries who knew them so well, and
whose heroism it were a sin to forget.
Without attempting to distinguish the
various personalities of these brave men,
let us take some descriptions of their routes
from their own lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;These places are called portages, inasmuch
as one is compelled to transport on
his shoulders all the baggage, and even the
boat, in order to go and find some other
river, or make one&rsquo;s way around these
rapids and Torrents; and it is often necessary
to go on for several leagues, loaded
down like mules, and climbing mountains
and descending into valleys, amid a thousand
difficulties and a thousand fears, and
among rocks or amid thickets known only
to unclean animals.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We returned by an entirely different
road from that which we had followed
when going there. We passed almost continually
by torrents, by precipices, and by
places that were horrible in every way. In
less than five days, we made more than
thirty-five portages, some of which were a
league and a half long. This means that
on these occasions one has to carry on his
shoulders his canoe and all his baggage,
and with so little food that we were constantly
hungry, and almost without strength
and vigor. But God is good and it is only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
too great a favor to be allowed to consume
our lives and our days in his holy service.
Moreover, these fatigues and difficulties&mdash;the
mere recital whereof would have frightened
me&mdash;did not injure my health....
I hope next Spring to make the same journey
and to push still farther toward the
North Sea, to find there new tribes and
entire new Nations wherein the light of
faith has never yet penetrated.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;On the third day of June, after four
Canoes had left us to go and join their families,
we made a portage which occupied an
entire day spent now in climbing mountains
and now in piercing forests. Here we
had much difficulty in making our way, for
we were all laden as heavily as possible&mdash;one
carrying the Canoe, another the provisions,
and a third what we needed in our
commercial transactions. I carried my
Chapel and my little store of provisions;
there was no one who was not laden and
sweating from every pore. We entered,
somewhat late, the great river Manikovaganistikov,
which the French call rivi&egrave;re
Noire [&ldquo;Black river&rdquo;], because of its depth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
It is quite as broad as the Seine and as swift
as the Rhone. The eleven portages which
we had to make there and the numerous
currents which it was necessary to overcome
by dint of paddling gave us abundant
exercise.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what detracts from this river&rsquo;s [St.
Lawrence] utility is the waterfalls and
rapids extending nearly forty leagues,&mdash;that
is from Montreal to the mouth of Lake
Ontario,&mdash;there being only the two lakes
I have mentioned where navigation is easy.
In ascending these rapids it is often necessary
to alight from the canoe and walk in
the river, whose waters are rather low in
such places, especially near the banks.
The canoe is grasped with the hand and
dragged behind, two men usually sufficing
for this.... Occasionally one is obliged
to run it ashore, and carry it for some time,
one man in front and another behind&mdash;the
first bearing one end of the canoe on
his right shoulder, and the second the
other end on his left.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now when these rapids or torrents are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
reached, it is necessary to land and carry
on the shoulder, through woods or over
high and troublesome rocks, all the baggage
and the canoes themselves. This is
not done without much work; for there are
portages of one, two, and three leagues, and
for each several trips must be made, no
matter how few packages one has.... I
kept count of the number of portages, and
found that we carried our canoes thirty-five
times, and dragged them at least fifty. I
sometimes took a hand in helping my Savages;
but the bottom of the river is full of
stones so sharp that I could not walk long,
being barefooted.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;But the mission of the Hurons lasted
more than sixteen years, in a country
whither one cannot go with other boats
than of bark, which carry at the most only
two thousand livres of burden, including
the passengers&mdash;who are frequently obliged
to bear on their shoulders, from four to six
miles, along with the boat and the provisions,
all the furniture for the journey; for
there is not, in the space of more than 700
miles, any inn. For this reason, we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
passed whole years without receiving so
much as one letter, either from Europe or
from Kebec, and in a total deprivation of
every human assistance, even that most
necessary for our mysteries and sacraments
themselves,&mdash;the country having neither
wheat nor wine, which are absolutely indispensable
for the Holy Sacrifice of the
Mass.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The following are extracts from the
instructions given to missionaries concerning
their conduct on the journey from
Montreal to the Huron country (1637):</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Fathers and Brethren whom God
shall call to the Holy Mission of the Hurons
ought to exercise careful foresight in regard
to all the hardships, annoyances, and perils
that must be encountered in making this
journey.... To conciliate the Savages,
you must be careful never to make them
wait for you in embarking. You must
provide yourself with a tinder box or a
burning mirror, or with both, to furnish
them fire in the daytime to light their
pipes, and in the evening when they have
to encamp; these little services win their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
hearts.... You must try and eat at daybreak
unless you can take your meal with
you in the canoe; for the day is very long,
if you have to pass it without eating. The
Barbarians eat only at Sunrise and Sunset,
when they are on their journeys. You
must be prompt in embarking and disembarking;
and tuck up your gowns so
that they will not get wet, and so that
you will not carry either water or sand
into the canoe. To be properly dressed,
you must have your feet and legs bare;
while crossing the rapids you can wear
your shoes, and, in the long portages, even
your leggings.... It is not well to ask
many questions, nor should you yield to
your desire to learn the language and to
make observations on the way; this may
be carried too far. You must relieve those
in your canoe of this annoyance, especially
as you cannot profit much by it during the
work.... Each one should be provided
with half a gross of awls, two or three
dozen little knives called jambettes [pocket-knives],
a hundred fishhooks, with some
beads of plain and colored glass....
Each one will try, at the portages, to carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
some little thing, according to his strength;
however little one carries, it greatly pleases
the Savages, if it be only a kettle....
Be careful not to annoy any one in the
canoe with your hat; it would be better to
take your nightcap. There is no impropriety
among the Savages.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>With the foregoing introduction to the
subject of portage paths and the nature of
the journey over them, their historical importance
is next to be noted.</p>

<p>In 1611 Champlain laid the foundation
for Montreal, and two years later pushed
northwest up the Ottawa River in search
of a northwest passageway to the East, but
he only reached Isle des Allumettes, the
Indian &ldquo;half-way house&rdquo; between the St.
Lawrence and Lake Huron. Two years
later the missionary Le Caron pushed up
the same long voyage; following the Ottawa
and Mattawan he entered the famous
portage to Lake Nipissing which opened
the way to &ldquo;Mer Douce&rdquo;&mdash;Lake Huron.
Champlain soon followed Le Caron over
the same course and reached Lake Nipissing
by the same portage. In his campaign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
against the Iroquois in central New York,
Champlain also found another route to
Lake Huron, by way of Lake Ontario, the
Trent, and the Lake Simcoe portage.
Champlain&rsquo;s unfortunate campaigns against
the Iroquois were of far-reaching effect;
one of the significant results being to drive
the French around to Lakes Huron, Michigan,
and Superior by way of the Lake
Nipissing and Lake Simcoe portages.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The
finding of Lakes Huron and Ontario and
the routes to them was the hardy &ldquo;Champlain&rsquo;s
last and greatest achievement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An interpreter of Champlain&rsquo;s,  Etienne
Brul&eacute;, was the first to push west of &ldquo;Mer
Douce&rdquo; and bring back descriptions that
seem to fit Lake Superior. This was in
1629. Five years later Nicollet drove his
canoe through the Straits of Mackinaw,
discovered the &ldquo;Lake of the Illinois&rdquo;&mdash;Lake
Michigan&mdash;and from Green Bay went
up the Fox and crossed the strategic portage
to the Wisconsin. He affirmed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
if he had paddled three more days he would
have reached the ocean!</p>

<p>Though Lake Erie was known to the
French as early as 1640 it was not until
1669 that it was explored or even approximately
understood. In September of that
year the two men who rank next to Champlain
as explorers, La Salle and Joliet, met
on the portage between Lake Ontario and
Grand River, and discussed the question of
what the West contained and how to go
there. They had heard of a road to a
great river and they both were men to do
and dare. They parted. Joliet went to
Montreal, having converted the two Sulpitian
missionaries Galin&eacute;e and Dollier to
his belief that the western road would be
found by passing to the western lakes.
They therefore left La Salle and went up
through the Strait of Detroit, and Galin&eacute;e
made the first map of the Upper Lakes
now in existence.</p>

<p>La Salle on the other hand, believing a
story told him by the Senecas, held that
the road sought lay to the southwest, and
it is practically agreed today that he
passed from near Grand River across Lake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Erie southward, and entered the stream
which was later known as the Ohio, and
passed down this waterway perhaps to the
present site of Louisville, Kentucky. If
modern scholarship in this case is correct,
La Salle was the discoverer of the sweeping
Ohio, having come to it over the
Lake Erie-Rivi&egrave;re aux B&#339;ufs portage,
or the Lake Erie-Chautauqua portage.
There is little reason to believe he ascended
the Cuyahoga and descended the
Tuscarawas and Muskingum as has been
feebly asserted. The Ohio, if it was at
this time actually discovered by La Salle,
remained almost unknown for nearly a
century.</p>

<p>In 1672 Frontenac detailed Joliet to make
the discovery of the Mississippi and the
adventurer went westward to Mackinaw
where he met Marquette. The two went
down Green Bay, up the Fox, and across
the portage to the Wisconsin; on June 17,
1673, they entered the Mississippi River.
Returning, they ascended the Illinois and
(probably) the Kankakee; crossing the
portage to the St. Joseph they were again
afloat on Lake Michigan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The indomitable La Salle built a vessel
of sixty tons on Lake Erie in 1679&mdash;the
&ldquo;Griffin,&rdquo; first craft of her kind &ldquo;that ever
sailed our inland seas above Lake Ontario.&rdquo;
In her La Salle was to sail to near the
Mississippi; part of this ship&rsquo;s cargo comprised
anchors and tackling for a boat in
which the explorer would descend the
Mississippi and reach the West Indies. The
&ldquo;Griffin&rdquo; was lost, but her builder pushed
on undismayed to the valley of the Illinois
River. Late in 1679 he built Fort Miamis
at the mouth of the St. Joseph, and in
December he passed up that river and over
the portage to the Kankakee which Joliet
and Marquette had traversed six years
before. &ldquo;Passing places soon to become
memorable in western annals ... he
finally stopped at a point just below the
[Peoria] lake and began a fortification. He
gave to this fort a name that, better than
anything else, marks the desperate condition
of his affairs. Hitherto he had refused
to believe that the &ldquo;Griffin&rdquo; was lost&mdash;the
vessel that he had strained his resources
to build, and freighted with his fortunes....
But as hope of her safety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
grew faint, he named his fort <i>Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Broken
Heart.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Leaving here his thirty men under
Tonty to build a new boat, and sending
Hennepin to the Upper Mississippi, the
indomitable hero set out for Canada to
secure additional material for his new boat.
Ascending the Kankakee he crossed the
portage to the western extremity of Lake
Erie and passed on through the lakes to
Niagara.</p>

<p>Fort Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur was plundered and
deserted, but La Salle, in the winter of
1681-82 was again dragging his sledges
over the portage to the Illinois on his way
to the great river which he, first of Europeans,
should fully traverse, &ldquo;but which
fate seemed to have decreed that he should
never reach.&rdquo; On the ninth of the following
April the brave man stood at last at its
mouth, and beside a column bearing the
arms of France, a cross and a leaden plate
claiming all the territory from which those
waters came, he took possession of the
richest four million square miles of earth
for Louis XIV. &ldquo;That the Mississippi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Valley was laid open to the eyes of the
world by a <i>voyageur</i> who came overland
from Canada, and not by a <i>voyageur</i> who
ploughed through the Atlantic and the Gulf
of Mexico from Spain, is a fact of far-reaching
import. The first Louisiana was the
whole valley; this and the Lake-St.
Lawrence Basin made up the second New
France ... the two blended and supplemented
each other geographically....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The second New France was united to
Louisiana by hinges; these hinges were
the portage paths which joined them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The importance of these routes of travel
did not by any means pass when once the
explorers and missionaries had hurried over
them and brought back news of the lands
to which they led. The economic history
of these routes is both interesting and important,
and should be considered, perhaps,
before reviewing their military significance.</p>

<p>As we have had occasion to notice, straits
and portages were famous meeting places.
La Salle and Joliet met between Lake Erie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and Lake Ontario; Joliet and Marquette
met at Mackinaw. All routes converged on
these narrow land and water courses, while
on the broad lakes sojourners passed each
other at short distances unwittingly. For
in the old days of canoes the coming and
going routes varied with a thousand circumstances.
Of course the traveler&rsquo;s general
rule was to reach quickest waters
flowing toward his destination. If he was
making for the mouth of the Mississippi
from Montreal his best route would be to
turn south from Lake Ontario to the first
easterly head of the Allegheny River, in
preference to pushing further west to the
head of any of the other tributaries of the
Mississippi. Following the same rule, the
route from Quebec to the Kennebec Valley
was by way of Moosehead Lake; the return
route was by way of the Dead River. A
person returning from the &ldquo;Falls of the
Ohio&rdquo; (Louisville, Kentucky) to Canada
would, other things being equal, make for
the nearest head of a stream flowing into
Lake Erie.</p>

<p>In the case of the Great Lakes, winds
and changing water-level soon became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
understood and governed travel. Parties
journeying from Mackinaw to Illinois
or the Mississippi would hold to the
western coast of Lake Michigan, for here
they were favored by the winds, and proceeded
southward by the Fox-Wisconsin
portage or the Chicago-Illinois portage.
In returning they would, under ordinary
circumstances, choose the Kankakee-St.
Joseph portage which would obviate the
necessity of stemming the Illinois or Wisconsin
and crossing Lake Michigan. The
more direct route to the head of the Maumee
was not discovered or appreciated until
later. Thus traffic, on the lakes at least,
was not on the bee line that it is today, and
thus it was that portage paths and straits
were famous meeting-places and camping
spots.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Straits, in many cases, may be
classed with portages; often a portage was
necessary only in one direction. On the
rivers the same portages were usually the
routes of parties ascending and descending,
but on such a stream as the St. Lawrence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>they were frequently different; descending
<i>voyageurs</i> &ldquo;shot&rdquo; many rapids about which
it was necessary to make a portage when
ascending.</p>

<p>As a meeting place the portage must have
been anticipated with an interest inconceivable
to us who know comparatively
nothing of woodland journeying. Eager
eyes were often strained to catch first sight
across the water of the opening where the
portage path entered the woods. And
when this opening was lost to the sight of
the departing traveler, the last hope of
meeting friends had vanished. What this
meant in a day when friends were few and
far to seek and enemies quite the reverse,
it would be difficult even to hint. Even in
the good old colonial days in the heart of
New England, friends met at the tavern,
when a neighbor was to make a little journey
on horseback, to drink his health.
Pioneers moving from New York City to
what is now Utica spent an afternoon previous
to starting in prayer with clergymen.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
What, then, did partings and meetings
mean in the earliest days on the Great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Lakes and St. Lawrence&mdash;when every
rapid was a danger and every wood concealed
an enemy?<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Letters were sometimes
left hanging conspicuously on trees at
portages.</p>

<p>The social nature of the portage camping
ground is illustrated by the meetings&mdash;friendly
and otherwise&mdash;between the Indian
retinues of the many travelers who
encamped here. When C&eacute;loron journeyed
from Quebec to the Ohio Valley with his
leaden plates, he paused at one of the portages
to allow his Indian allies to jollify
with certain comrades whom they met
here.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> There are cases where such meetings
resulted more seriously than mere
drunken sprees.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The meeting-place was also the famous
camping ground. To reach the portage
path the tired paddler bent every energy
as the red sun lay on the horizon. Two
landings were thus saved. Here the
ground around either end of the path had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
been cleared and trodden hard by a thousand
campers, and if wood was scarce in
the immediate locality there was abundance
at no great distance. No one familiar with
camping need be told the advantages, natural
and artificial, to be found on an old
camping ground.</p>

<p>But here it should be noted that the
shortest portage between any two bodies
of water was rather an arbitrary line, at
least theoretically so. It was chosen as a
good site, not for staying, but for passing.
Usually it traversed some sort of watershed,
more or less distinct; on either side
low ground, marshes, and swamps were not
uncommon. In many instances the length
of the portage path varied inversely with
the stage of the water. Some portages
were a mile long in wet seasons and ten
miles long in dry. Where this was true
the country through which the path ran
was not altogether suitable for camps nor
for villages, which the camps on important
portages often became. Often, however,
the nature of the country was favorable for
habitation, and at many portages the camps
became permanent. At such points Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
villages were sometimes found; but as a
rule portages were not largely inhabited
unless they were defended, and that was
not until the era of military occupation.</p>

<p>The portages were frequently used as
burying grounds by the Indians, and beside
the little paths around the rapids of the
river lies the dust of hundreds swept away
to their death by the boiling waters. The
portages were not infrequently on high, dry
ground, favorable for interment.</p>

<p>Here, too, on the portages the toiling
missionaries were wont to pause and erect
their crosses and altars. In the long journeys
back and forth from Quebec to the
land of the Hurons, for instance, the portage
paths of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence
became familiar ground; where one had
raised an altar another would be glad to
pray. There were silent, holy places on
these little roads by which we run noisily
today&mdash;we who know little of the suffering,
the devotion, and the piety of those
who first walked and worshiped here.</p>

<p>The missionaries called the Indian trails
&ldquo;Roads of Iron&rdquo; to suggest the fatigue
and suffering endured in their rough jour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>neys.
If the ordinary trail was a Road of
Iron, what of the portage path&mdash;which so
often led over cliffs and mountain spurs in
going around a waterfall or rapid? But
these were not the most difficult portages.
There were many carrying places which,
uniting heads of streams or lakes, ran over
high mountains, through the most impenetrable
fastnesses&mdash;paths fit only for mountain
goats. Yet up these rough steeps the
missionaries of the Cross, soldiers, and
traders forced their way, slipping, sliding,
seizing now and again at any object which
would offer assistance. Many of these
climbs would tax a person free of baggage
in this day of cleared fields and hills; fancy
the toil of the old-time <i>voyageurs</i> weighed
down by canoes, provisions, and baggage,
assailed by the clouds of insects which
greeted a traveler in the old forests, and
perhaps enduring fears of unseen enemies
and unknown dangers.</p>

<p>Then there was the stifling heat of the
primeval forests. Our present day notion
of forests is diametrically opposed to old-time
experience. To us, the forest is a
popular symbol of restful coolness; former<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>ly
they were exhausting furnaces in the hot
season, where horses fell headlong in their
tracks and men fainted from fatigue. We
wonder sometimes that pioneer armies frequently
accomplished only ten or twelve
miles a day, sometimes less. But these
marches were mostly made in the months
of October and November&mdash;the dryest
months of the year in the Central West&mdash;and
the stifling heat of the becalmed forest
easily explains both slowness and wearing
fatigue. It was the heat that all leaders of
pioneer armies feared; for heat meant thirst
and at this season of the year the ground
was very dry. Many a crazed trooper has
thrown himself into the first marsh or
swamp encountered and has drunk his fill
of water as deadly as any bullet.</p>

<p>All this applies with special force to portages,
as all know who have essayed mountain
climbing in the stifling heat of a
windless day. All that marching troops
have endured, the brave missionaries and
those who came after them suffered on the
carrying place with the additional hardship,
often, of climbing upward in the heat rather
than marching on level ground. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
attempting to gain some idea of the physical
effort of old-time traveling, the cost of crossing
a difficult portage must be considered
as the most expensive in time and strength.
The story of C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s climb up from Lake
Erie to Lake Chautauqua, Hamilton&rsquo;s struggle
through the beaver dams and shoals of
Petite Rivi&egrave;re on the Maumee-Wabash portage
route, Arnold&rsquo;s desperate invasion of
Canada over &ldquo;The Terrible Carrying Place&rdquo;
on the Kennebec-Chaudi&egrave;re route, and the
history of the difficulties of the Oneida portage
at Rome, New York, present to us
pictures of the portages of America that can
never fade from our eyes.</p>

<p>At the ends of many of the portage paths
were to be found busy out-door work-shops
in the old days of pirogues and canoes.
The trees nearby and far away stood stark
and white against the forest green, having
lost their coats of bark; many were fallen,
and others were tottering. Here and there
were scattered the refuse pieces of bark and
wood. The ends of portage paths were
famous carpenter shops.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> There were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
humble libraries here, too. It was while
wintering on the Chicago portage that
Marquette wrote memoirs of his voyages.</p>

<p>In some instances, too, peculiar relics of
the old life in the heyday of the canoe have
come down to us. The end of the portage
path, besides being a camping spot, was
the provisioning place. Here food was to
be made or to be secured and properly seasoned
and packed. At the old French
portages stone ovens were erected, in which
quantities of bread might be baked before
starting on a journey. At either end of
the Chautauqua portage between Lake Erie
and Lake Chautauqua such little monuments
have been discovered. In each case
the baking place was a circular piece of
masonry of stone laid in strong mortar,
three feet in height and three or four feet
in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The portages between many waters
crossed important transverse watersheds
along which coursed the great landward
routes of primeval America. Here at the
junction of the greater and lesser paths were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
wide, open spaces where many a camp has
been raised and struck, where assemblies
innumerable have been harangued, where
a thousand ambuscades have been laid and
sprung.</p>

<p>Portage paths crossed the watersheds
which were frequently boundary lines.
They also connected river valleys which
came to be boundary lines. Consequently
these routes of travel became themselves,
in several instances, important boundaries.
This is illustrated by the line decided upon
at the Fort Stanwix Treaty; in several
instances the territory of the United
States has been bounded by a little portage
path&mdash;such as that between the Cuyahoga
and Tuscarawas Rivers in Ohio&mdash;which is
now quite forgotten. In this instance the
little path is still to be identified from the
fact that it was a boundary line for such a
length of time that the lands on the eastern
and western sides were surveyed by different
systems. The &ldquo;Great Carrying Place&rdquo;
between the Hudson and Lake George was
one of the boundaries of the first grant of
land made by the Mohawks at Saratoga.
At the Treaty of Fort McIntosh, 1785, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
western boundary line of the United States
included the courses of two portage paths.</p>

<p>As in Maine, of which subsequent mention
is to be made, so throughout the continent,
portage paths were commonly named
from the destinations to which they led;
thus they had two names, as is true of
highways in general. In certain instances,
as in the case of the &ldquo;Oneida Carrying-place&rdquo;
well-known portages had one general
name. To the portages about the
rapids on such rivers as the St. Lawrence
and Ottawa, descriptive names were given
by the French. One was called &ldquo;Portage
de l&rsquo;&Eacute;pine,&rdquo; another &ldquo;Portage des Roses&rdquo;&mdash;suggestive
of the fragrant wild rose which
overhung the path to the annoyance of the
traveler in spite of its perfume. Another
path was known as &ldquo;Portage Talon.&rdquo;
Perhaps the most fanciful name recorded
is &ldquo;Portage de la Musique&rdquo;&mdash;where the
river&rsquo;s tide boiled noisily over the rocks
and reefs, forever chanting the same
song. Other names were &ldquo;Portage des
Chats,&rdquo; &ldquo;Portage de Joachin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Portage
de la Roche fendue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Portage des
Chenes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Portage des Galots.&rdquo; One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>

<h3>THE EVOLUTION OF PORTAGES</h3>


<p>From every point of view the portages
of America, considered historically,
were most important, because by reason
of their strategic position they were
coigns of vantage for military operations.</p>

<p>Picture the continent at the opening of the
culminating phases of the Old French War
in 1740-1760. For nearly two centuries
military and civil officials, missionaries and
traders had been passing to and fro on
the Ottawa, St. Lawrence, and Richelieu,
through Canada, Illinois, and Louisiana,
erecting forts and establishing chapels and
trading stations. Little by little the English
settlements had crept back into the
interior. Ten score of portage paths had
been traversed; forts and blockhouses had
been built, captured, burned, and rebuilt.
Flying parties of French had swooped
down into New York, and English and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Dutch had chased them back. Both sides
had become more and more acquainted
with the geography of the continent, and
now, when war was about to begin in
earnest, both antagonists leaped forward
quickly to seize for once and all the vital
spots in the &ldquo;communications&rdquo; in the
neutral ground between them, where the
vanguards had been bickering and fighting
for at least a century.</p>

<p>The Richelieu River, Lake Champlain,
and the Hudson had offered the founders
of Quebec and Montreal the most direct
course to the New England settlements.
They had learned it well in their campaigns
against the Iroquois. The keys of this
route were the portage paths between the
St. Lawrence and the Richelieu in the
north; and the portages between Lakes
Champlain and George, and Lake George
and the Hudson River in the south. As
early as 1664 Jacques de Chambly erected
a fort at the foot of the rapids, at Chambly
on the Richelieu, at the end of the thirteen-mile
portage from La Prarie three
miles above Montreal on the St. Lawrence.
Two other forts, Fort St. Louis and Fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Sainte Terese, also guarded the Richelieu
River; and at its head, at the foot of Lake
Champlain, stood Fort Richelieu.</p>

<p>Later a portage path fifteen miles in
length was built from La Prarie (Laprairie)
to Fort John (St. Johns), below the &ldquo;Island
of St. Therese.&rdquo; Ascending Lake Champlain
the French quickly perceived the
strategic positions of Crown Point and
&ldquo;Carillon&rdquo;&mdash;at the end of the portage
from Lake George&mdash;where they erected
Fort Crown Point in 1727, and Fort Frederick
(Ticonderoga) in 1731.</p>

<p>The English on the other hand ascended
the Hudson from Albany, and built Fort
Ingoldesby at Stillwater in 1709, and Fort
Nicholson at Fort Edward in the same
year. At the Wood Creek end of the portage
another fort was built first named Fort
Schuyler, later named Fort Anne. Fort
Edward and Fort William Henry were
built in 1755.</p>

<p>This chain of forts from Albany to Montreal,
guarding the important passageways
on land and water, marks the line of
what was known as &ldquo;the Grand Pass from
New York to Montreal.&rdquo; The last struggle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
for this line of communication, Johnson&rsquo;s
rebuke to the advancing Dieskau, Abercrombie&rsquo;s
stroke at Fort Ticonderoga, the
brilliant Montcalm&rsquo;s capture of Fort William
Henry, and, finally, the wresting of the
Champlain Valley from the French by the
hitherto defeated English, forms a unique
romance which finds its key of action at
the portage paths which united the Hudson,
Lake George, and Lake Champlain.</p>

<p class="center">[<i>Showing important portages between the St. Lawrence and New England rivers</i>]<br />

</div>

<p>There were other routes into New England,
known of old, on which the French
had spread terror throughout the North
Atlantic slope. They came up the Chaudi&egrave;re
and down the Kennebec into Massachusetts&rsquo;
&ldquo;Province of Main.&rdquo; Early in
the French and Indian wars Massachusetts
began another series of campaigns, to
secure again and once for all the Kennebec
Valley, building Forts Halifax (1754) and
Western (1752) at the head of navigation.
At the northern end of the portage between
the Kennebec and &ldquo;Rivi&egrave;re Puante,&rdquo; on
the Morris map of 1749, here presented,
we find the Indian village Wanaucok still
described as a nest of &ldquo;Indians in the
French interest.&rdquo; These allies of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the French around the highland portages
explain the need of English forts on the
Kennebec. The forts of the Connecticut
River were largely necessitated by the
routes of travel between the heads of its
tributaries and the &ldquo;Rivi&egrave;re S<sup>t</sup>. Francis&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Otter River.&rdquo; On the Morris map
we read &ldquo;Indians of S<sup>t</sup>. Francis in league
with the French.&rdquo; The mouth of Otter
Creek was near Fort Ticonderoga, and it
offered, with a portage to the Connecticut,
another route of French aggression.
&ldquo;From this Fort the French make their
excursions,&rdquo; reads the interesting Morris
map, &ldquo;and have this war [1745 <i>seq.</i>] burnt
and destroy&rsquo;d two Forts (Saratoga and Fort
Massachusets) and broke up upwards of 30
Settlements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Hudson-Lake George portage marked
the most important course from Canada to
New York, but there was another route
which was fought for earnestly. The
French could ascend the St. Lawrence to
Lake Ontario and gain access to the entire
rear of New York, and by a dozen minor
waterways the Hudson again could be
reached. The St. Lawrence had long been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
an avenue of French exploration and missionary
activity. &ldquo;The route thither (from
Quebec up the St. Lawrence to Lake Ontario
and Lake Simcoe to Georgian Bay to
the land of the Hurons) is very easy, there
being only two waterfalls where it is necessary
to land and make a portage&mdash;a short
one at that; and there it would be easy to
construct a small redoubt for the purpose
of maintaining free communication and of
making ourselves masters of this great
lake.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Thus the Jesuits &ldquo;had anticipated
by twenty years Frontenac&rsquo;s plan of building
a fort for the control of Lake Ontario.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
Fort Frontenac (Kingston, Canada, 1673)
guarded the French end of Lake Ontario,
while the English ascended the Mohawk
and descended the &ldquo;Onnondaga&rdquo; (Oswego)
to its mouth (Oswego, New York) where
they erected Fort Oswego in 1722, which
Montcalm captured in 1757.</p>

<p>To reach the mouth of the Onondaga,
the English crossed the already well-worn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
path, the &ldquo;Oneida Portage&rdquo; a mile in
length, between the Mohawk River and
Wood Creek. The strategic position of
this path is not shown more clearly than
by the number and importance of the military
works erected there, Forts Williams
(1732), Bull (1737), Newport and famed
Stanwix (1758). Throughout the old
French War this strip of ground was the
scene of bloody battles, massacres, and
sieges; and its detailed story&mdash;a fascinating
one&mdash;should be written immediately.
The Mohawk end of the portage path forms
the main avenue of Rome, New York, and
at the center of the little city the site of
Fort Stanwix, &ldquo;a fort which never surrendered,&rdquo;
is appropriately marked. It is
the boast of the Romans that from this site
the stars and stripes were &ldquo;first unfurled
in battle&rdquo; August 3, 1777. The flag was
made from an officer&rsquo;s blue camlet cloak
and the red petticoat of a soldier&rsquo;s wife.
The white stars and stripes were cut from
ammunition bags. The news that Congress,
on June 14, had adopted the flag had
just reached the inland portage fortress by
a batteau from down the Mohawk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The granting of the vast area of land on
the Ohio River by the King of England to
the Ohio Land Company in 1749 brought
home to the French the realization that the
West was disputed territory, and Governor
Galissoni&egrave;re immediately dispatched C&eacute;loron
de Bienville with a band of two hundred
and seventy men to re&euml;nforce the French
claim to the Ohio Valley. It is an ancient
French custom to bury leaden plates at the
mouths of rivers as a sign of possession,
and C&eacute;loron bore a supply of such memorials
to bury at the mouths of rivers emptying
into the Ohio. Ascending the St.
Lawrence the party crossed Lake Ontario
to the Niagara River. This strategic
portage path around Niagara Falls,
which joined Lake Ontario and Lake Erie,
used from time immemorial, became
important to the French when they secured
the mastery of Lake Ontario after the erection
of Fort Frontenac. Four years after
the English came to Oswego the French
erected the first permanent Fort Niagara
here in 1726, absolutely controlling all
intercourse with the West by way of the
Great Lakes. It was the key of the lake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
system, and the numerous campaigns of the
English projected against Fort Niagara
until its capture in 1759 are evidence of
its strategic position and the importance of
the little worn road it guarded.</p>

<p>Once beyond the Niagara portage C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s
attention was turned to the rival
routes from Lake Erie to La Belle Rivi&egrave;re.
There were at least five passageways well-known
to the Indians. Of these the French
knew very little, for, having found the
Mississippi, they had been less interested
in this branch of it. But now that the
English were claiming and even settling
the land along its half-known shores it was
time they were enforcing their claims. So
C&eacute;loron made for the first portage southward
in order to strike the Ohio on its
headwaters. This was the Chautauqua
Lake portage from Chautauqua Creek&mdash;which
the French knew as &ldquo;Rivi&egrave;re aux
Pommes&rdquo;&mdash;six miles by land from the
present Barcelona, New York, to Lake
Chautauqua. From the seventeenth to the
twenty-second of July was spent in making
the difficult march over what has long been
known as the &ldquo;Old Portage Road.&rdquo; Bon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>n&eacute;camps,
who accompanied C&eacute;loron, wrote:
&ldquo;The road is passably good. The wood
through which it is cut resembles our
forests in France.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>C&eacute;loron went his way, having given great
prominence to the Chautauqua portage,
indirectly suggesting that it was the most
convenient pass from Lake Erie into the
disputed Ohio Valley. It remained for
another to mark a more practicable course.</p>

<p>C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s report to his governor was thoroughly
alarming, and a French force under
M. Marin was sent from Montreal in 1752
to fortify the route to the Ohio River and
to erect forts to hold that river itself.</p>

<p>After looking over the formidable Chautauqua
route, Marin moved along the shore
of Lake Erie to &ldquo;Presque Isle&rdquo; (Erie,
Pennsylvania), where the French had made
a settlement as early as 1735. Marin chose
to make this twenty-mile portage from
Presque Isle to &ldquo;Rivi&egrave;re aux B&#339;ufs&rdquo; the
armed route of French aggression into the
Ohio Valley, in preference to the shorter
but more tedious and more uncertain Chau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>tauqua
pass. At the northern end of the
portage he built Fort Presque Isle and at
its southern extremity Fort Le B&#339;uf.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The
arrival of the French upon the headwaters
of the Allegheny will forever be remembered
by the new and significant name
Washington now gave Rivi&egrave;re aux B&#339;ufs&mdash;which
the stream still bears&mdash;French
Creek. Marin, who hurried on down the
Allegheny building Forts Machault (Venango)
at the junction of Rivi&egrave;re aux B&#339;ufs and
the Allegheny, and Duquesne at the junction
of Allegheny and Monongahela, should
have named the Youghiogheny &ldquo;English
Creek.&rdquo; When once on the way, the time
taken by the French and English to reach
the key position of the West&mdash;Pittsburg&mdash;varied
inversely as the length of the portages
they had to traverse. It will be
remembered that Washington in his first
campaign of 1754 explored carefully the
Youghiogheny River in the hope that the
road he had just opened from the Potomac
at Cumberland, Maryland to the &ldquo;Great
Crossings&rdquo; (Smithfield, Pennsylvania) might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
after all be a portage path between Atlantic
waters and the Mississippi system. He
found the Youghiogheny useless.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The
English route to the Ohio was practically
an all-land route; Braddock received a
little help from the Potomac but did not
even attempt to use any western river, nor
did Forbes in 1758 or Bouquet in 1763.
The Monongahela, downward from Redstone
Old Fort (Brownsville, Pennsylvania),
at the end of Burd&rsquo;s road, began to be used
in the Revolutionary period, and in pioneer
days was a famous point of embarcation for
western travelers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the French portage at
Presque Isle was the key to their position
in the Ohio Valley, for over it came every
ounce of ammunition and stores for Fort
Duquesne. It was Braddock&rsquo;s purpose in
1755 to ascend the Allegheny after the capture
of Fort Duquesne, raze the forts that
guarded this portage path, and then meet
Governor Shirley who was marching upon
Niagara.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> With Fort Duquesne captured,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Forts Le B&#339;uf and Presque Isle razed, and
Fort Niagara besieged, the French would
have had as little hope of holding the Ohio
Valley as the Shenandoah. Nothing could
show more plainly the signification of these
fortified portages than the campaigns
directed against them.</p>

<p>Further west, the Maumee Valley was of
early importance to the French because of
the two portages which gave them access
to the Miami River on the south and the
Wabash on the southwest. The use to
explorers of the latter portage has been
mentioned. Here, near the present site of
Maumee City, the first settlement of whites
in the limits of the state of Ohio was made
about 1679. The city of Fort Wayne,
Indiana, marks the Maumee terminus of
the important portage to the Wabash
River&mdash;the modern name carrying the
significance of fortification which we are
emphasizing. It is to be deplored that the
name Fort Stanwix, rather than Rome, is
not retained for the city at the Mohawk
terminus of the Oneida Portage in New
York. Here the French built forts in 1686
and 1749, the latter being surrendered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
1760. Here General Anthony Wayne built
a fortress in 1794 which controlled all traffic
over the old pathway as had its predecessors.</p>

<p>Passing further west, two forts, at least,
guarded well-known portages: Fort St.
Joseph&rsquo;s (1712), located a little below South
Bend, Indiana, guarding the Kankakee-
St. Joseph portage; and Fort Winnebago
(1829) guarding the Fox-Wisconsin portage.
The post Ouiatanon founded on the Wabash
in 1720 was the first military establishment
within what is now the state of Indiana.
It was located eighteen miles (by the river)
below the mouth of the Tippecanoe and
near the city of Lafayette. Many writers
have located this historic site incorrectly&mdash;a
mistake it is impossible to make when
the actual meaning of the post is understood.
It guarded the key of the upper
Wabash, for this point &ldquo;was the head of
navigation for pirogues and large canoes,
and consequently there was a transfer at
this place of all merchandize that passed
over the Wabash.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Coming down to the Revolutionary
period, the battles fought upon these por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>tages
and the forts that were built show that
these historic paths had lost little of their
significance. All the way across the continent
from the portage from the Kennebec
to Quebec, over which Arnold led
his army, to Fallen Timbers on the Maumee,
near which Wayne built Fort Wayne,
a significant portion of the struggle for a
free America took place on portage paths.
As in the French War, so in this later
struggle, the paths between Lake Champlain
and the Hudson and between the
Mohawk and Lake Oneida were all-important
passageways. Burgoyne was defeated
not far from the spot where the French
Dieskau was repulsed, and on the Oneida
carrying-place, as has been said, the first
United States flag was unfurled in battle
in 1777. In the West, of course, Niagara
never lost its importance, but the remainder
of the portages had now lost something of
their military significance, as the Revolution
in the West was a series of raids and
counter-raids on the settlements of the
whites in Virginia and Kentucky, and upon
the Indians in the valleys of the Muskingum,
Scioto, Sandusky, Maumee, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Wabash. Cross-country land routes were
well-worn at this date and few military
movements were made which involved
portages; such were Hamilton&rsquo;s capture of
Vincennes by way of the Maumee and the
Wabash, and Burd&rsquo;s keel-boat invasion up
the Licking River into Kentucky. Savage
strokes like those of Robertson and Sevier,
Clark at Vincennes, McIntosh, Lewis, Brodhead,
Bowman, Crawford, Harmar, St.
Clair, and Wayne were distinctively land
campaigns.</p>

<p>Yet in these, too, the value of the portage
routes is most clearly seen, as for instance
during the conquest of the northwestern
Indians by General Anthony Wayne in
1793-94. The permanent headquarters of
Wayne were at Fort Washington (Cincinnati),
and temporary headquarters were at
Fort Greenville (Greenville, O.) and Fort
Defiance (Defiance, O.) The conquest was
directed northward up the Great Miami
Valley to the heads of the Wabash and
Maumee. It was directed against the
Indian villages, as was true of Harmar&rsquo;s
and St. Clair&rsquo;s campaigns before it; and
these villages, like so many others, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
located in part at the portages between the
Miami, Auglaize, St. Mary, and Wabash.
At these places Wayne struck swiftly&mdash;building
Forts Greenville, Recovery,
Adams, and a fort on the headwaters of the
Auglaize, the name of which is not known.
From these points he made his heroic campaign
of 1794 in the valleys of the Maumee,
Auglaize and St. Mary. But with the successful
prosecution of this campaign General
Wayne&rsquo;s work was not done. The country
conquered must be held&mdash;the crops destroyed
must not be resown&mdash;the villages
destroyed must not be rebuilt. All this
was as important a feat as the victory
at Fallen Timber, and much more difficult.</p>

<p>And so, in the months succeeding his
victory, Wayne did as valuable work for
his country as at any time, and one of the
most important of his plans was a movement
which looked toward holding the northern
portages from the Miami River to the St.
Mary and Auglaize. In a letter to the Secretary
of War, dated October 17, 1794, at
the Miami villages, Wayne observes: &ldquo;The
posts in contemplation at Chillicothe, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Picque town, on the Miami of the Ohio, at
Lormie&rsquo;s stores, on the north branch, and
at the old Tawa town, will reduce the land
carriage of dead or heavy articles, at proper
seasons, viz: late in the fall, and early in
the spring, to thirty-five miles, and in
times of freshets, to <i>twenty</i> in place of 175,
by the most direct road to Grand Glaize,
and 150 to the Miami villages, from fort
Washington, on the present route, which
will eventually be abandoned, as the one
now mentioned will be found the most
economical, and surest mode of transport,
in time of war, and decidedly so in time of
peace.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>From Greenville on the twelfth of November
he wrote again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as circumstances will admit,
the posts contemplated at Picque town,
Lormie&rsquo;s stores, and at the old Tawa towns,
at the head of navigation, on Au Glaize
river, will be established for the reception,
and as the deposites, for stores and supplies,
by water carriage, which is now
determined to be perfectly practicable, in
proper season; I am, therefore, decidedly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of opinion, that <i>this</i> route ought to be
totally abandoned, and <i>that</i> adopted, as the
most economical, sure, and certain mode
of supplying those important posts, at
Grand Glaize and the Miami villages, and
to facilitate an effective operation towards
the <i>Detroit</i> and Sandusky, should that measure
eventually be found necessary; add to
this, that it would afford a much better
chain for the general protection of the frontiers,
which, with a block house at the
landing place, on the <i>Wabash</i>, eight miles
southwest of the post at the Miami villages,
[southern end of the Maumee-Wabash portage
path on Little River] would give us
possession of all the portages between the
heads of the navigable waters of the Gulfs
of Mexico and St. Lawrence, and serve as
a barrier between the different tribes of
Indians....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In the treaty of Greenville,
signed by the confederated nations
and the United States authorities, the
reserved tracts indicate the line of policy
previously suggested by General Wayne,
and the following section emphasizes the
strategic meaning of the portages of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
interior of the West: &ldquo;And the said Indian
tribes will allow to the people of the United

the portage aforesaid, at or near Loramie&rsquo;s

leads to the Wabash and then down the
Wabash to the Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>As a site for forts the old portage paths
came to take an important place in the
social order of things. In many parts
settlements were safe only within the immediate
vicinity of a fort. Often they
were safe only within the palisade walls of
upright logs;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and around these interior
fortresses the first lands were cleared and
the first grain sowed. They were trading
posts as well as forts&mdash;indeed many of the
portage forts were originally only armed
trading stations located at the portages
because these were common routes of travel.
Around them the Indians raised their huts
when the semi-annual hunting seasons were
over. Thus on the portage, settlements
sprang up about the forts to which the
military r&eacute;gime had no objection&mdash;though
such settlements were discouraged equally
by those devoted to the earliest fur trade
and to missionary expansion.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> But mili<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tary
officers found their one hope of retaining
the land lay in allying the Indians
firmly with them. The attempts of the
French so to shift the seats of the Indian
tribes in the West that the English could
not trade with them or deflect them from
French interest forms an interesting chapter
in the early rivalry for Indian support.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
This never appeared more acute than at
Fort Duquesne in 1758 when Forbes&rsquo;s army
was approaching and the brave missionary
Post was among the Delawares urging them
to leave the region about the fort and abandon
the French.</p>

<p>These portage forts being, oftentimes,
half-way places, were convenient points for
conventions and treaties. The Treaty of
Fort Stanwix (1768) was one of the most
important in our national history; other
conventions, such as at Fort Watauga
(1775), Fort Miami (1791), Greenville (1795),
and Portage des Sioux (1815), are instances
of important conventions meeting at half-way
fortresses on or near the portage
passageways.</p>

<p>When the pioneer era of expansion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
dawned, these worn paths, in many cases,
became filled with the eager throngs hastening
westward to occupy the empire
beyond the mountains. The roads the
armies had cut during the era of military
conquest became the main lines of the
expansive movement and only the waterways
which gave access to the Ohio River
or the Great Lakes were of great importance.
The two important roadways which
served as portages were the Genesee Road
from the Mohawk to Buffalo, and Braddock&rsquo;s
Road from Alexandria, Virginia to Brownsville
(Redstone Old Fort), Pennsylvania.
The heavier freight of later days tended
to lengthen the old portages, as each terminus
had to be located at a depth of water
which would float many hundred-weight.
But, as in the old days of canoes, the stage
of water still determined the length of
portage. Freight sent over the Alleghenies
for the lower Ohio River ports of
Indiana and Kentucky was shipped at
Brownsville if the Monongahela contained
a good stage of water; if not, the wagons
continued onward to Wheeling with their
loads. Old residents at such points as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Rome, New York; Watertown, Pennsylvania;
Akron, Ohio; Fort Wayne, Indiana
remember vividly the pioneer day of the
portages when barrels of salt and flour,
every known implement of iron, mill
stones, jugs and barrels of liquor, household
goods, seeds, and saddles composed
the heterogeneous loads that were dragged
or rolled or hauled or &ldquo;packed&rdquo; over the
portages of the West. Strenuous individuals
have been known to roll a whiskey
barrel halfway across a twenty-mile portage.</p>

<p>With the settling of the country and a
new century came a new age of road-building.
Travel until now had been on north
and south routes&mdash;on portage paths, which
usually ran north and south between the
heads of rivers which flowed north or south,
on routes of the buffalo, which the herds
had laid on north and south lines during
their annual migrations, and on Indian
trails which had been worn deep by the
nations of the north and those of the south
during their immemorial conflicts. The
main east and west land routes, such as
Forbes&rsquo;s and Braddock&rsquo;s,  were now to be
replaced by well-made thoroughfares. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the building of certain of these, the dominating
influence of water transportation,
and, consequently, the strategic routes
between them, were considered of utmost
importance. This is emphasized strikingly
in the building of the Cumberland
National Road across the Alleghenies by
the United States Government (1806-1818).
In the Act passed by Congress enabling
the people of Ohio to form a state we read:
&ldquo;That one-twentieth of the net proceeds
of the lands lying within said State sold by
Congress shall be applied to the laying out
and making public roads leading from the
navigable waters emptying into the Atlantic,
to the Ohio.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The Commissioners
appointed according to law by President
Jefferson surveyed the territory through
which the road should pass and met at
Cumberland, Maryland for consultation.
In their report of 1806 they said: &ldquo;In this
consultation the governing objects were:</p>

<p>1. Shortness of distance between navigable
points on the eastern and western
waters.</p>

<p>2. A point on the Monongahela best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
calculated to equalize the advantages of this
portage in the country within reach of it.</p>

<p>3. A point on the Ohio river most capable
of combining certainty of navigation
with road accommodation; embracing, in
this estimate, remote points westwardly, as
well as present and probable population on
the north and south.</p>

<p>4. Best mode of diffusing benefits with
least distance of road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In their choice of Cumberland as the
eastern terminus for this national road the
question of portage entered largely into
consideration: &ldquo;... it was found that
a high range of mountains, called Dan&rsquo;s,
stretching across from Gwynn&rsquo;s to the
Potomac, above this point, precluded the
opportunity of extending a route from this
point in a proper direction, and left no
alternative but passing by Gwynn&rsquo;s;  the
distance from Cumberland to Gwynn&rsquo;s
being upward of a mile less than from the
upper point, which lies ten miles by water
above Cumberland, the Commissioners
were not permitted to hesitate in preferring
a point which shortens the portage, as
well as the Potomac navigation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>After outlining the route of the road, the
Commissioners summed up matters as follows:
&ldquo;... it will lay about twenty-four
and a half miles in Maryland, seventy-five
and a half in Pennsylvania, and twelve
miles in Virginia; ... this route ... has
a capacity at least equal to any other in
extending advantages of a highway; and
at the same time establishes the shortest
portage between the points already navigated,
and on the way accommodates other
and nearer points to which navigation may
be extended, and still shorten the portage.... Under
these circumstances the
portage may be thus stated:</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Cumberland to Monongahela,
sixty-six and one-half miles. From Cumberland
to a point in measure with Connelsville,
on the Youghiogeny river, fifty-one
and one-half miles. From Cumberland to
a point in measure with the lower end of
the falls of the Youghiogeny, which will
lie two miles north of the public road,
forty-three miles. From Cumberland to
the intersection of the route with the
Youghiogeny river, thirty-four miles....
The point which this route locates, at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
west foot of Laurel Hill, having cleared
the whole of the Alleghany mountain, is so
situated as to extend the advantages of an
easy way through the great barrier, with
more equal justice to the best parts of the
country between Laurel Hill and the Ohio.
Lines from this point to Pittsburg and
Morgantown, diverging nearly at the same
angle, open upon equal terms to all parts
of the western country that can make use
of this portage; and which may include
the settlements from Pittsburg up Big
Beaver, to the Connecticut reserve, on Lake
Erie, as well as those on the southern borders
of the Ohio and all the intermediate
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus it is clear that our one great
national turnpike was, in reality, a portage
path. Upon this same general principle
many of our first highways were built, in
an era when inland water navigation, on
canal and river, was considered the secret
of commercial prosperity.</p>

<p>With the building of canals, the ancient
portages again became prominent because
of geographical position; in every state the
portage paths marked the summit levels.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
In the cases of such important works as the
Erie Canal and the Ohio Canal the portages
between the Mohawk and Wood Creek in
New York and between the Cuyahoga and
Tuscarawas in Ohio were of vital importance.
In many instances, at the points
where the old portages mark the spots of
least elevation, two canals are found converging
from three or four valleys.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible for us to realize the
importance attached to the portage routes
in days when steam navigation and locomotion
were not dreamed of. This is
suggested by the clause of the famous
Ordinance of 1787 in which they were again
declared to be &ldquo;common highways forever
free.&rdquo; Washington&rsquo;s serious study of this
subject is exceedingly interesting&mdash;not
less so because many of his plans which
seemed to many idle dreaming were completely
realized not long after his death.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>With the advent of the era of railway
building, and as the number of the shining
rails increase yearly at these geographical
centers, the strategic nature of the portage
routes has been and is still being strongly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
emphasized. Engineering art is now defying
nature everywhere, and daring feats of
bridge-building are daily accomplished;
but the old routes and passes still remain
the most practicable, and in the long run
pay best. In spite of the fact that tunnels
can go wherever money dictates, and
bridges can be swung across the most
baffling chasms, at the same time the fiercest
struggles for rights of way (outside the
cities) are being waged today for the portage
paths first trod by the Indian.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>NEW ENGLAND&mdash;CANADIAN PORTAGES</h3>


<p>The territory lying between the St.
Lawrence River and the Atlantic
seaboard offers an unexcelled field
for the study of portage paths and their
part in the history of the continent. The
student of this branch of arch&aelig;ology finds
at his disposal the admirable studies of Dr.
William F. Ganong, which cover an important
portion of this field.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> From these
studies (the best published account) the following
general statements concerning Indian
routes of travel are very enlightening:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Indians of New Brunswick, like
others of North America, were, within
certain limits, great wanderers. For hunting,
war, or treaty making, they passed
incessantly not only throughout their own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
territory, but over that limit into the lands
of other tribes. The Indian tribes of Acadia
have never, within historic times, been
at war with one another, but they joined
in war against other tribes and mingled
often with one another for that and other
reasons. In facilities for such travels our
Indians were exceptionally fortunate, for
the Province is everywhere intersected by
rivers readily navigable by their light
canoes. Indeed I doubt if anywhere else
in the world is an equal extent of territory
so completely watered by navigable streams,
or whether in any other country canoe
navigation was ever brought to such a pitch
of perfection or so exclusively relied upon
for locomotion. The principal streams of
the Province lead together curiously in
pairs, the country is almost invariably
easy to travel between their sources, and
a route may be found in almost any
desired direction.... No doubt, an Indian
in selecting his route of travel to a
given point, where more than one offered,
would average up, as a white man would
do, the advantages and drawbacks of each
for that particular season, taking account<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of the length of the routes, amount of falls
and portaging, the height of the water,
etc., and his decision would be a resultant
of all the conditions and would be different
in different seasons. It is not easy to understand
why so many routes from the St.
John to Quebec were in use, unless some
offered advantages at one time, others at
another. Between the heads of the principal
rivers were portage paths. Some of
these are but a mile or two long&mdash;others
longer. Some of these portages are still in
use and uninfluenced by civilization. A
good type is that between Nictor Lake and
Nepisiguit Lake, which I have recently
seen. The path is but wide enough to
allow a man and canoe to pass. Where it
is crossed by newly fallen trees the first
passer either cuts them out, steps over
them, or goes round, as may be easiest,
and his example is followed by the next.
In this way the exact line of the path is
constantly changing though in the main its
course is kept. No doubt some of these
paths are of great antiquity. Gesner states
that one of the most used, that between
Eel River Lake and North Lake, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
route from the St. John to the Penobscot,
had been used so long that the solid rocks
had been worn into furrows by the tread of
moccasined feet; and Kidder quotes this
and comments upon it as probably the most
ancient evidence of mankind in New England.
A somewhat similar statement is
made by Monro as to the Misseguash&mdash;Baie
Verte portage. I have seen something
very similar on the old portage path around
Indian Falls on the Nepisiguit, but I am
inclined to think it is the hob-nailed and
spiked shoes of the lumbermen which have
scored these rocks, and not Indian moccasins
and it is altogether likely that this
explanation will apply also to the case mentioned
by Gesner, whose over-enthusiastic
temperament led him into exaggerated
statements. In New Brunswick the lines
of regular travel seem to have followed
exclusively the rivers and the portage paths
between their heads, and there is no
evidence whatever of former extensive
trails leading from one locality to another
through the woods, such as are well known
to have existed in Massachusetts. The
difference in the distribution and navi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>gability
of the rivers amply explains this
difference. It is not, of course, to be supposed
that the Indians never departed from
these routes; in their hunting expeditions
they undoubtedly wandered far and wide,
and especially in the valleys of the smaller
and navigable brooks. Moreover, they
undoubtedly had portages used only on
rare occasions, and also at times forced
their way over between streams where
there was no regular route, but in general
the main rivers gave them ample facilities
for through travel from one part of the
Province to another, and they had no other
method. The birch canoe was the universal
vehicle of locomotion to the New
Brunswick Indian; it was to him what the
pony is to the Indian of the West.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The labour of crossing the portages
was always severe, but the Indians took,
and take, it philosophically, as they do
everything that cannot be helped. While
canoe travel in good weather, on full and
easy rivers, is altogether charming, it
becomes otherwise when low water, long
portages and bad weather prevail. We
obtain vivid pictures of its hardships from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the narratives of St. Valier, and from several
of the Jesuit missionaries. Since many
of the portage paths are still in use by
Indians, hunters, and lumbermen, their
positions are easy to identify, and many of
them are marked upon the excellent maps
of the Geological Survey. Many others,
however, have been long disused, and have
been more or less obliterated by settlement,
or by roads which follow them, and
these are not marked upon our recent maps.
I have made a special effort to determine
the exact courses of these portages before
they are lost forever, and where I have
been able to find them by the aid of residents
I have given them on the small maps
accompanying this paper. All portages
known to me are marked upon the map of
New Brunswick, in the Pre-historic or
Indian period accompanying this paper,
and their routes of travel are in red on the
same map. The lines show how thoroughly
intersected the Province was by their routes.
This map does not by any means mark all
the navigable rivers, but only those which
form parts of through routes of travel.
The relative importance of routes I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
tried to represent by the breadth of the
lines, the most important routes having the
broadest lines. Many of the most ancient
portages had distinct names but I have not
recovered any of these. Kidder gives as
the ancient Indian name of Eel River&mdash;North
Lake Portage the name Metagmouchchesh
(variously spelled by him), and I have
heard that more than one was called simply
&ldquo;The Hunters&rsquo; Portage&rdquo; by the
Indians, possibly to distinguish the less
important ones used only in hunting from
those of the through routes. When Portages
are spoken of at this day they are
usually given the name of the place towards
which they lead; thus, a person on the
Tobique would refer to the portage at the
head of that river as the Nepisiguit, or the
Bathurst Portage, and on the Nepisiguit, he
would speak of it as the Tobique Portage.
This usage seems to be old and perhaps it is
widespread. Thus Bishop Plessis, in his
journal of 1812, speaking of the portage
between Tracadie and Tabusintac Rivers
(the latter leading to Neguac), says (page
169): &lsquo;We reached a portage of two miles
which the people of Tracadie call the Ni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>gauek
Portage, and those of Nigauek the
Tracadie Portage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The situations of many of the old portages
are preserved to us in place names.

<p>The chief routes of travel were along the
sea-coasts and up and down the valley of
the St. John River&mdash;the latter routes being
of most importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all Indian routes,&rdquo; writes Dr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Ganong, &ldquo;in what is now the Province of
New Brunswick, the most important by far
was that along the River St. John. This
river was, and is, an ideal stream for canoe
navigation. It not only has easy communication
with every other river system in
this and the neighbouring provinces, but
it is in itself very easy to travel.... The
St. John rises in Maine and its head waters
interlock with those of the Penobscot, and
with the Etechemin flowing into the St.
Lawrence near Quebec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under the system of the St. John-Restigouche
portage Dr. Ganong thus describes
the Grand River&mdash;Wagan path:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This was the most travelled of all routes
across the Province. The Grand River is
easy of navigation up to the Wagansis (i.e.,
Little Wagan), up which canoes could be
taken for some two miles. A level portage
of two or three miles leads into the Wagan
(Micmac <i>O-wok-un</i>, &lsquo;a portage&rsquo;) a muddy,
winding brook, which flows into the Restigouche,
which to its mouth is a swift but
smooth-flowing stream, unbroken by a fall,
and almost without rapids. The total fall
from the portage is not over 500 feet, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
hence it is far easier to ascend than the
Nepisiguit, and consequently was the main
route across from Bay Chaleur to the St.
John. For the upper waters of the St.
John a route from the mouth of the Nepisiguit
by Bay Chaleur to the Restigouche
and thence to the St. John would be both
considerably shorter and much easier than
by the Nepisiguit&mdash;Tobique route.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This portage is marked on Bouchette,
1815, Bonner, 1820, Lockwood, 1826, Wilkinson,
1859, and the Geological Survey
Map. On Van Velden&rsquo;s original survey
map of the Restigouche, 1786, a &lsquo;Carrying-place
across the highlands&rsquo; about nine
miles is given, doubtless a portage directly
from Wagan to Grand River. This route
was taken by Plessis in 1812, (Journal, 267),
by Gordon (p. 23), who fully describes it,
and by many others. It is said in McGregor&rsquo;s
British America, 1833 (II., 66), that
the courier then travelled up this river with
mails for New Brunswick and Canada,
evidently by this route. Formerly the
alders which blocked the Wagan and
Wagansis were cut out by travellers, and
even by workmen paid by the Provincial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Government (as I have been told), but since
a road has been cut within a few years
from the St. John directly through to the
Restigouche at the mouth of the Wagan,
this route is no longer used, and probably
is now practically impassable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the St. John&mdash;St. Lawrence system Dr.
Ganong describes seven routes; we use his
own words:</p>


<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Touladi&mdash;Trois Pistoles Portage</span></p>

<p>This was one of the principal routes from
the St. John to Quebec. It led through
Lake Temiscouata by the Touladi River to
Lac des Aigles, thence to Lac des Islets,
thence by a short portage path to the Bois-bouscache
River and down the Trois Pistoles.
This route is described in Bailey
and McInnes&rsquo; Geological Report of 1888,
M, pages 26, 28, 29, where it is called &ldquo;one
of the main highways ... between the
St. John River and the St. Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ashberish&mdash;Trois Pistoles Portage</span></p>

<p>Another route from Temiscouata to Trois
Pistoles was by way of the Ashberish
River. This portage is marked on Bouchette,
1831, and is mentioned by him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
his Topographical Dictionary, and by Bailey
in his &lsquo;St. John River&rsquo; (page 48). It was
by either this or the last-mentioned route
that Captain Pote was taken to Quebec in
1745, as he describes in his Journal, but
the description is not clear as to which route
was followed. The compass directions and
the portages and lakes mentioned by him
would rather indicate the Ashberish route,
though the editor of the Journal sends him
by the Lac des Aigles. This route is shown
on the Franquelin-DeMeulles Map of 1686,
with the continuous line used on that map
for portage routes, and it is probably this
route that is marked on Bellin of 1744, and
on many following him.</p>


<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Temiscouta&mdash;Rivi&egrave;re du Loup Portage</span></p>

<p>As early as 1746 a portage path was projected
along this route where now runs the
highway road. A document of 1746 (Quebec
MS. IV., 311) reads, &ldquo;Nous donnons les
ordres n&eacute;cessaires pour faire pratiquer un
chemin ou sentier d&rsquo;environ 3 pieds dans le
portage depuis la Rivi&egrave;re du Loup &agrave; 40
lieues audessous de Qu&eacute;bec jusques au Lac
T&eacute;misquata d&rsquo;ou l&rsquo;on va en canot par la<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
rivi&egrave;re St. Jean jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; Beaubassin, et ce
pour faciliter la communication avec l&rsquo;Escadre
et pour y faire passer quelques
d&eacute;tachement de fran&ccedil;ois et sauvages s&rsquo;il
est n&eacute;cessaire.&rdquo; Whether or not this path
was made we do not know. In 1761 this
route was examined by Captain Peach (as
a map in the Public Record Office shows),
and about 1785, a road was cut along it as
a part of the post route from Quebec to
Nova Scotia. From that time to the present
it has been much travelled, and is often
referred to in documents and books.</p>


<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">St. Francis&mdash;Rivi&egrave;re du Loup Portage</span></p>

<p>The exact course of this portage I have
not been able to locate, but it probably ran
from Lake Pohenegamook to some of the
lakes on the La Fourche branch of the
Rivi&egrave;re du Loup. The Indian name of the
St. Francis, <i>Peech-un-ee-gan-uk</i> means the
Long Portage (<i>Peech</i>, long, <i>oo-ne-gun</i>, a portage,
<i>uk</i>, locative). The first recorded use
of this portage is in Le Clercq in his
&ldquo;&Eacute;tablissement de la Foi.&rdquo; He states that
about 1624, R&egrave;collet missionaries came to
Acadia from Acquitaine, and thence went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to Quebec in canoes by the River Loup with
two Frenchmen and five Indians. It is
first shown roughly on a manuscript map of
1688, very clearly on Bellin, of 1744, and
on several others following him, and on
Bouchette of 1815. It is mentioned in a
document of 1700 (Quebec MS. V. 348) as
four leagues in length. It was by this
route St. Valier came from Quebec to Acadia
in 1686 or 1687, and a very detailed
account of the difficulties of the voyage is
given in his narrative. He states that he
travelled a short distance on the Rivi&egrave;re
du Loup and Rivi&egrave;re des Branches and a
long distance on the St. Francis. This
route he describes as shorter but harder
than that ordinarily used.</p>

<p>On the unpublished DeRozier map of
1699 two portages are shown in this region,
one from some branch of what is apparently
the St. Francis to the Trois Pistoles,
and one from another river to the westward
of the St. Francis, perhaps from Lac de
l&rsquo;Est, to the Rivi&egrave;re du Loup, but they are
given too inaccurately to admit of identification.</p>

<p>Between the Temiscouata and St. Francis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
basins are several portages; one from Long
Lake at the head of the Cabano to the St.
Francis, and another from Long Lake to
Baker Lake; and there are other minor
ones, all marked on the Geological Survey
map.</p>


<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Black River&mdash;Ouelle Portage</span></p>

<p>On some early maps, such as Bellin,
1744, the Ouelle is made to head with a
branch of the St. John, which can be only
the Black River. The Morris map of 1749
marks a portage from the St. John to the
Ouelle, and has this statement: &ldquo;Expresses
have passed in seven days by these Rivers
from Chiegnecto to Quebec.&rdquo; The exact
route of this portage I have not been able
to determine.</p>


<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">North-West Branch&mdash;Rivi&egrave;re du Sud
Portage</span></p>

<p>This portage is first referred to in a letter
of 1685 from D&eacute;nonville to the Minister:
&ldquo;Je joins a cette carte un petit dessin du
chemin le plus court pour se rendre d&rsquo;icy
en huict jours de temps au Port Royal en
Acadie, par une rivi&egrave;re que l&rsquo;on nomme du
Sud et qui n&rsquo;est qu&rsquo;a huict ou dix lieues au<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
dessous de Quebec. On le ramonte environ
dix lieues et par un portage de trois lieues
on tombe dans celle de St. Jean qui entre
dans la baye du Port Royal.&rdquo; This is
probably the Grand Portage referred to by
Ward Chipman in one of his letters of the
last century.</p>


<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">St. John Lake-Etchemin Portage</span></p>

<p>Portages between these rivers are mentioned
by Bouchette under &ldquo;Etchemin&rdquo;
in his Topographical Dictionary. The
river received its name from its use by the
Etchemins (Maliseets and Penobscots) as
a route to Quebec.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large portion of the St. John Valley
lies in the state of Maine and all that was
true of New Brunswick, so far as early
methods of locomotion are concerned, was
and is true of Maine in a great measure.
Maine, however, was not bounded on two
sides by the ocean.</p>

<p>Both the Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers
were ancient and important routes of travel
between Quebec and the sea. Of the two
the Penobscot was, perhaps, the easier to
navigate but the Kennebec was the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
important route. James Sullivan writing
of the Kennebec in the last decade of the
eighteenth century observes: &ldquo;The Kenebeck
... receives the eastern branch, at
fifty miles distance from Noridgewock.
The main branch of the Kenebeck, winding
into the wilderness, forms a necessity for
several carrying places, one of which, called
the Great Carrying Place, is five miles
across, and the river&rsquo;s course gives a distance
of thirty-five miles, for that which is
gained by five on the dry land. At one
hundred miles distance, or perhaps more
from the mouth of the eastern branch, the
source of the main or western branch of
the Kenebeck is found extended a great
distance along side the river Chaudi&egrave;re,
which carries the waters from the high
lands into the St. Lawrence. The best
description of this branch of the Kenebeck,
is had from the Officers who passed this
route under the command of General
Arnold, in 1775.... The carrying place
from boatable waters in it, to boatable
waters in the river Chaudi&egrave;re, is only five
miles over.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the most interesting maps of the
Kennebec-Chaudi&egrave;re route may be mentioned
Montresor&rsquo;s map of 1761, &ldquo;A
Draught of a route from Quebec to Fort
Halifax,&rdquo; in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The
route is there given as up the &ldquo;Yadatsou
Chaudiere or Kettle River.&rdquo; When Wolf
River was reached it was ascended; then
to &ldquo;River Ahoudaounkese.&rdquo; Here was a
portage of five miles to within about that
distance of Lake Oukeahoungauta; portage
of about one half mile to Loon Lake; thence
into Moosehead Lake at the head of the
east branch of the Kennebec. A portage
could be made into the Penobscot; and at
the southeastern extremity of Moosehead
Lake are the words &ldquo;Portage to the Penobscot.&rdquo;
The return route was up the
Kennebec to &ldquo;The Great Carrying Place
to River of Tewyongyadight or the Dead
River.&rdquo; This was Arnold&rsquo;s route, already
referred to by Mr. Sullivan. Ascending
the Dead to &ldquo;The Amaguntic Carrying
Place&rdquo; (a portage of about four miles) the
route is marked to &ldquo;the River of Mekantique&rdquo;
and through &ldquo;The meadow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Mekantique;&rdquo; thence through &ldquo;Lake of
Me&rsquo; Kantique de St Augustin&rdquo; and into
the Chaudi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>Perhaps the earliest map showing a road
throughout the Kennebec and Chaudi&egrave;re
valleys is &ldquo;A New Map of Nova Scotia &amp;
Cape Britain&rdquo; (1755) in the British Public
Records Office.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The road bears the name
&ldquo;Kenebec Road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the Haldimand Papers in the
British Museum<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is a most interesting
&ldquo;Journal from the last settlements on the
Chaudiere to the first Inhabitants on Kennebec
River kept by Hugh Finley, from
the 13th of September that he left Quebec
until the 30th that he arrived at Falmouth
in Casco Bay in the P[r]ovince of the Massachusets
Bay&mdash;1773.&rdquo; Finley had been
appointed &ldquo;Surveyor of Post roads on the
Continent of North America&rdquo; and, in view
of the tedious length and the common
retardments of the Lake Champlain route
between Canada and New England, determined
to explore the Chaudi&egrave;re-Kennebec
route. Four Indian guides accompanied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the surveyor, who were &ldquo;to mark (as they
should pass along in their rough way) the
Path by which a good road might be cut.&rdquo;
The last farm on the Chaudi&egrave;re was &ldquo;52
Miles S. Easterly of Quebec.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
reaches in this river are long between rapid
and rapid, but navigable for batteaus only.&rdquo;
On the fifteenth the party had reached
&ldquo;Rapide du Diable;&rdquo; seven miles further
was &ldquo;La Famine&rdquo; River where were two
huts. Four miles further they arrived at
&ldquo;des loups&rdquo; River. This was the common
upward route of travel as the upper Chaudi&egrave;re
route was interrupted by ponds,
swamps, etc. Concerning Indian maps Mr.
Finley makes an interesting statement:
&ldquo;It is impossible to guess distances from
an Indian draft, that people have no idea
of proportion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the eighteenth the party encamped
early in the afternoon &ldquo;on purpose to pack
up our Provisions &amp;c. in proper Packages
to be distributed in proportional burthens
to each of the party as we were next day
to proceed thro the woods.&rdquo; Then came
a desperate journey of nine miles in nine
hours up steeps, over and under trees which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
tore the canoes and almost exhausted their
bearers. At the end of two small lakes a
half mile portage brought the travelers to
another lake. &ldquo;Half over this carrying
place is the just hight of Land between
Canada &amp; New England,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Finley,
&ldquo;consequently the boundary line
between the Province of Quebec and Massachusets
Bay will be a line drawn half way
between the Lake we just left and this
Lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Finley this portage was
ninety-six miles from Quebec and forty-six
from the last house on the Chaudi&egrave;re&mdash;by
the route he had traversed. He proceeded
down the Kennebec, up the &ldquo;Androcogkin&rdquo;
to Brunswick and across by land to
Casco Bay.</p>

<p>It is clear that the route from Quebec to
the Kennebec was by way of &ldquo;des loups&rdquo;
River to Moosehead Lake&mdash;named, writes
Finley, &ldquo;from a very remarkable Mountain
[on] the S side about nine miles down.
the Indians say that it resembles a moose
deer stooping.&rdquo; It is equally clear that
the route from the Kennebec to Quebec
was by way of the western branch, the
Dead River and the Chaudi&egrave;re.</p>

<p>This route was made historic by Arnold&rsquo;s
famous campaign of 1775 and has recently
been described with intense feeling by
Professor Justin H. Smith.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Arnold&rsquo;s men found lower Dead River,
as we can see from their journals, much as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
it now is. On both sides luxuriant grass
covered the plain, or faded out in the
reaches of poorer soil; tall evergreens,
rather thinly planted, soughed and swayed
above it; while here and there a glimpse
could be had of goodly mountains, the confines
of the valley.&rdquo; Professor Smith
graphically describes the trials of those
who traveled by water. Those who attempted
to travel the &ldquo;Kenebec Road&rdquo;
suffered even worse: &ldquo;The land parties
fared no better. It was impossible to keep
along the river. Detours and wide circuits
multiplied all distances. Swollen rivulets
had to be followed up until a narrow place
was found and a tree could be felled across
for a bridge. Once, if not more than once,
a party marched for miles up a stream only
to discover that it was not Dead River at
all. At night many of the men were unable
to find the boats and had to bivouac as they
could, without supper and without breakfast.&rdquo;
At last the brave band neared the
portage to the north-flowing waters.
Despite their distressing fatigues &ldquo;there
was only one thought:&rdquo; writes Professor
Smith, &ldquo;advance; and the army set for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>ward
as rapidly as possible on the twenty-fifth
and longest portage, four miles and a
quarter over the Height of Land. For
once their misfortunes wore the look of
blessings: there was little freight. The
provisions weighed only four or five pounds
per man. A large part of the gunpowder
proved to be damaged, and was thrown
away.... The bateaux had broken up
one by one, until some of the companies
had scarcely any left. Morgan had preserved
seven, and was determined on
taking them across, for there was no other
way to transport his military stores down
the Chaudi&egrave;re; but resolution of such a
temper was now beyond mere men. An
attempt was made to trail the bateaux up
a brook that enters Arnold Pond; but the
attempt had to be given up, and each company,
except Morgan&rsquo;s,  took only a single
boat over the portage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even in this light order, the troops were
hardly able to conquer the mountain.
There was a trail, to be sure, and Steele&rsquo;s
pioneers had bettered it; but a mountain
trail, even when good, is not a highway,
except in altitude. &lsquo;Rubbish&rsquo; had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
collecting here ever since creation, as it
seemed to Morrison, and a handful of tired
men could not remove it all in a few days&rsquo;
time. Ten acres of trees blown down across
the path had to be left there. A wet place
half a mile wide could not be rooted up.
Rocks, dead logs, gorges, and precipices
had to be stumbled over. The snow, hiding
pitfalls and stones, betrayed many a
foot into a wrench and a bruise. Those
who carried the boats&mdash;and no doubt all
carried in turn&mdash;suffered still more, for
bateaux and carriers often fell together
pell-mell down a slope into the snow.
&lsquo;The Terrible Carrying-place&rsquo;&mdash;that was
the soldiers&rsquo; name for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The portages between the Connecticut
River and the Canadian waters were of
great local importance during the Old
French War and the Revolution; they were
not as important to the country at large as
those of the northeast. The two of special
significance were routes to the St. Francis
River, Lake Memframagog and Otter Creek
(flowing into Lake Champlain). Fort
Number Four &ldquo;had been built by Massachusetts
when it was supposed to be within<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
its limits. It was projected by Colonel
Stoddard, of Northampton, and was well
situated, in connection with the other
forts, on the western frontier, to command
all the paths, by which the Indians
travelled from Canada to New-England.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
This fort was on the celebrated
highway from the Connecticut across
country to Fort Edward on the Hudson
River, so largely traveled throughout the
period of military operations. In 1755
during Sir William Johnston&rsquo;s campaign
against Fort Crown Point, New Hampshire
raised five hundred men, under the command
of Colonel Joseph Blanchard. &ldquo;The
Governor,&rdquo; writes Belknap, &ldquo;ordered them
to Connecticut river, to build a fort at
Cohos, supposing it to be in their way to
Crown Point. They first marched to
Baker&rsquo;s-town, where they began to build
batteaux, and consumed time and provisions
to no purpose. By Shirley&rsquo;s advice
they quitted that futile employment, and
made a fatiguing march through the woods,
by the way of Number-four, to Albany.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
The failure to capture Crown Point this
year brought down a scourge of Indians
upon New Hampshire, particularly from
the St. Francis River, between which and
the Connecticut there was &ldquo;a safe and easy
communication by short carrying-places.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
But the white men found this route ere
long and themselves carried destruction up
the St. Francis Valley.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>When in 1759, General Amherst was
preparing to complete Wolfe&rsquo;s victory by
reducing the remainder of Canada, eight
hundred New Hampshire men proceeded
under Colonel John Goffe to Fort Number
Four. &ldquo;But instead of taking the old
route, to Albany, they cut a road through
the woods, directly toward Crown Point.
In this work they made such dispatch, as
to join that part of the army which Amherst
had left at Crown Point, twelve days
before their embarkation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> This road

miles; at the end of which, they found a
path, made the year before; in which they
passed over the mountain to Otter Creek;
where they found a good road, which led
to Crown Point. Their stores were brought
in waggons, as far as the 26 miles extended;
and then transported on horses over the
mountains. A drove of cattle for the supply
of the army went from No. 4, by this

<h3>NEW YORK PORTAGES</h3>


<p>The strategic value of the &ldquo;Great
Pass&rdquo; from New York by way of
the Hudson, Lakes George and
Champlain, and the Richelieu River has
already been emphasized. The important
military points on the route were the portages
from the Hudson to Lake George,
from Lake George to Lake Champlain, the
narrows at Crown Point, and the portage
from Chambly to La Prairie on the St.
Lawrence. These portages are marked on
numerous early maps; the Hudson-Lake
George portage is quite accurately drawn
on Colonel Romer&rsquo;s Map of 1700.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> From
that year on throughout the century the
greater accuracy with which it is mapped
illustrates its growing importance.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting early descriptions
of this famous pass is given on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>

<p>Perhaps the most detailed description of
the Pass is given by a former prisoner
among the French who has written the
following observations on a copy of a

Lake George.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The text shows that the
date of the observations is about 1756:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lake Champlain (besides being the only
Channel by which the English can possibly
invade Canada from their frontiers) is the
only one by which they can be Invaded
from thence, for through the whole Extent
of the South Bank of S<sup>t</sup>. Lawrence River,
or the great Lakes there is not another
Communication by which an Army can be
brought Sufficient to make any Conquest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forts which guarded this historic
route have been mentioned, and it is possible
here only to hint of the remarkable
story of the ebb and flow of the war tides
which have made the &ldquo;Grand Pass&rdquo;
perhaps the most alluring field of study in
America. Under the specific title &ldquo;Saratoga
and the Northern War-path&rdquo; an
entertaining writer has sketched the place
in history occupied by this water thoroughfare
and its vital land connections.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The
story beginning far back in the seventeenth
century includes De Tracy&rsquo;s expedition to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the Mohawk country in 1666; between 1686
and 1695 &ldquo;numerous war parties passed
through <i>Kay-ad-ros-se-ra</i> and Saratoga on
their way to and from the hostile settlements
on the St. Lawrence and the Mohawk
and lower Hudson.&rdquo; A list of the important
expeditions only would include those
of 1689; 1690, under Le Moyne upon
Schenectady; 1690, under General Winthrop;
1691, under Major Schuyler; and
1693-95. From this time peace reigned
until Queen Anne&rsquo;s War in 1709. This
year witnessed Winthrop&rsquo;s and Nicholson&rsquo;s
campaigns; in 1711 Nicholson again swept
up the Hudson on his way toward Quebec,
but was compelled to abandon his plan.
From 1713 until 1744 there were thirty-one
years of peace&mdash;during which time the
French built Forts Crown Point and Ticonderoga
on Lake Champlain. In 1744 the
war was again resumed; &ldquo;during this short
war no less than twenty-seven marauding
parties swept down from Fort Frederick at
Crown Point upon the settlers of what are
now Saratoga and Rensselaer counties.&rdquo;
On June 17, 1747, in the night, the new
English Fort Clinton at Saratoga was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
attacked by La Corne. In the following
year it was destroyed by the English
because of its exposed situation, and Albany
once more became the most northern outpost.
The peace signed in 1748 lasted until
the outbreak of the final struggle in 1755.
Then followed Johnson&rsquo;s,  Winslow&rsquo;s,  and
Abercrombie&rsquo;s campaigns up the Hudson
against Ticonderoga, and Montcalm&rsquo;s
swoop upon Fort William Henry.</p>

<p>In 1777 the &ldquo;Northern War Path&rdquo;
became again the route of armies&mdash;and
here the decisive battle of Saratoga was
fought and won. Of this campaign mention
will be made again.</p>

<p>The western war-route to the Lakes was
up the Mohawk and down the Onondaga
(Oswego) Rivers. Albany and Oswego
were its termini; and the Oneida carrying-place
of one mile (in favorable seasons)
between the Mohawk River and Wood
Creek, at Rome, New York, was its key.
This famous route is interestingly described
by Mr. Sylvester as follows:<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The first carrying place on the great
western route was from the Hudson at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Albany through the pine woods to the
Mohawk at Schenectady. This carrying
place avoided the <i>Ga-ha-oose</i> Falls. At the
terminus of the old Indian carrying place
on the Hudson, now called Albany, the
Dutch, under Hendrick Christiensen,
in 1614, built Fort Nassau on Castle
Island.... In 1617 they built another
fort at the mouth of the Normanskill, at
the old Indian <i>Ta-wa-sent-ha</i>&mdash;&lsquo;the place of
the many dead.&rsquo; In 1623 Fort Orange was
built by Adriaen Joris, and eighteen families
built their bark huts and spent there
the coming winter....</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the year 1662 Arendt van Curler,
and other inhabitants of Fort Orange,
&lsquo;went west&rsquo; across the old carry through
the pines to the rich Mohawk flats and
founded a settlement. To this settlement
they applied the old Indian name of
Albany, calling it Schenectady. From
Albany it was the new settlement on the
Mohawk beyond the pines....</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Schenectady the western trail ran
up the Mohawk to what is now the city of
Rome, where there was another carry of a
mile in length, to the Wood Creek which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
flows into Oneida Lake. This carrying
place, afterward the site of Fort Stanwix,
was called by the Indian <i>Da-ya-hoo-wa-quat</i>
(Carrying-place). From it the old trail ran
through the Oneida Lake, and down the
Oswego River to Lake Ontario. At the
mouth of the Oswego River, on Lake
Ontario, was the old Indian village called
<i>Swa-geh</i>, the lake-port of the Iroquois....
Between Schenectady and <i>Swa-geh</i> was a
line of forts built for the protection of the
traveling fur-traders, and as barriers to
French and Indian invasion from the valley
of the St. Lawrence. The first of these was
at the mouth of the Schohariekill, and was
called Fort Hunter. It was built on the
site of old Indian <i>Te-hon-de-lo-ga</i>, the lower
castle of the Mohawks. Above Fort Hunter,
near the Indian <i>Ga-no-jo-hi-e</i>&mdash;&lsquo;washing
the basin&rsquo;&mdash;the middle Mohawk castle,
was Fort Plain. The Indian name of Fonda
was <i>Ga-na-wa-da</i>&mdash;meaning &lsquo;over the rapids.&rsquo;
Of Little Falls, it was <i>Ta-la-que-ga</i>&mdash;&lsquo;small
bushes,&rsquo; and of Herkimer the
Indian name was <i>Te-uge-ga</i>, the same as
the river. At Herkimer was Hendrick&rsquo;s
castle and Fort Herkimer, near <i>Ga-ne-ga-ha-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>ga</i>,
the upper Mohawk castle.... The
Indian name for Utica was <i>Nun-da-da-sis</i>&mdash;meaning
&lsquo;around the hill.&rsquo; At Utica, the
Indian trail from the west crossed the
river.... A little above Utica was a
small Indian station called <i>Ole-hisk</i>&mdash;&lsquo;the
place of nettles.&rsquo; This is now Oriskony,
one of the famous battle-grounds of the
Revolution.... At the mouth of Wood
Creek, on the Oneida Lake, a Royal Blockhouse
was built, and at the west end of
Oneida Lake, in 1758, Fort Brewerton was
built. The Indian name for Wood Creek
was <i>Ka-ne-go-dick</i>; for Oneida Lake was
<i>Ga-no-a-lo-hole</i>&mdash;&lsquo;head on a pole.&rsquo; For
Syracuse the Indian name was <i>Na-ta-dunk</i>,
meaning &lsquo;pine-tree broken with top hanging
down,&rsquo; and the Indian name of Fort
Brewerton was <i>Ga-do-quat</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Oneida portage&mdash;as the carrying
place between the Mohawk and Wood Creek
is known in history&mdash;was guarded at its
Mohawk terminus as early as 1732 by the
erection of Fort Williams, and at the Wood
Creek terminus as early as 1737 by Fort
Bull. Throughout the century of conflict
between French and English the Oneida<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
portage route was of utmost importance.
In the crucial years between 1755 and 1759
it was especially important. The route
is thus described in a contemporaneous
account:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oswego, along the accustomed route, is
computed to be about 300 miles west from
Albany. The first sixteen, to the village
of Schenectady, is land carriage, in a good
waggon road. From thence to the Little
Falls in the Mohawk River, at sixty five
miles distance, the battoes are set against
a rapid stream; which too, in dry seasons,
is so shallow, that the men are frequently
obliged to turn out, and draw their craft
over the rifts with inconceivable labour.
At the Little Falls, the portage exceeds not
a mile: the ground being marshy will admit
of no wheel-carriage, and therefore the
Germans who reside here, transport the
battoes in sleds, which they keep for that
purpose. The same conveyance is used at
the Great Carrying-Place, sixty miles beyond
the Little Falls; all the way to which
the current is still adverse, and extremely
swift. The portage here is longer or
shorter, according to the dryness or wetness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of the seasons. In the last summer months,
when rains are not infrequent, it is usually
six or eight miles across. Taking water
again, we enter a narrow rivulet, called the
Wood-creek, which leads into the Oneida
Lake, distant forty miles. This stream,
tho&rsquo; favorable, being shallow, and its banks
covered with thick woods, was at this time
much obstructed with old logs and fallen
trees. The Oneida Lake stretches from
east to west about thirty miles, and in calm
weather is passed with great facility. At
its western extremity opens the Onondaga
River, leading down to Oswego, situated at
its entrance on the south side of the Lake
Ontario. Extremely difficult and hazardous
is the passage thro&rsquo; this river, as it abounds
with rifts and rocks; and the current flowing
with surprising rapidity. The principal
obstruction is twelve miles short of Oswego,
and is a fall of about eleven feet perpendicular.
The portage here is by land, not
exceeding forty yards, before they launch
for the last time.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

site of Fort Williams in 1758 and Fort
Wood Creek (on the site of Fort Bull) and
Fort Newport were built about the same
time or a little earlier. In the British

commander-in-chief in North America, and
destroyed by Major-General Webb, August
31, 1756, before they were finished.
This map must ever be of entrancing
interest to the student who views it knowingly.
The strategic nature of this little
plot of ground was recognized, a century or
so ago, by a continent&mdash;indeed by a world.
In the Old French War there was not,
perhaps, so important a spot on the continent
as this, the path from the Hudson to
Lake George alone excepted. And when
it is recalled that the Oneida portage led to
the West&mdash;to the Lakes and the Ohio
Basin&mdash;the Oneida path, taken throughout
the years, can but be considered of pre&euml;minent
importance, commercially.</p>

<p>A visit to thriving little Rome and a
study of the country roundabout will prove<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of appealing interest. Here, within cannon
shot, stood half a dozen forts; here, in the
very center of Rome is the wide straight
roadway over which millions of pioneers
moved to their conquest of the West; here
is the junction of the Black River and the
Erie Canal, which, &ldquo;conceived by the
genius, and achieved by the energy of De
Witt Clinton, was, during the second quarter
of this [nineteenth] century, the most
potent influence of American progress and
civilization.&rdquo; And, in its turn, here lie
the gleaming rails of the New York Central&mdash;and
the &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; has covered the
canal boat with dust.</p>

<p>The conditions here make it almost possible
to say, &ldquo;All roads lead to Rome, New
York.&rdquo; From one and the same point of
observation it is possible to see the junction
of the Erie and Black River Canals, the
portage path from the Mohawk to Wood
Creek, the New York Central Railway, and
the terminus of the Utica and Mohawk
Valley Electric Railway. Two canals, a
highway, a railway, and an electric line
converging within an air-rifle shot would
not be found in a town of only a few thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>sand
inhabitants were it not for some
extraordinary geographical reason.</p>

<p>In the olden days the adage was very
true indeed, though Rome was not the old-time
name. It is deemed a pity that Stanwix
could not have been preserved as the
name of this historic site, but it is said the
revulsion against everything English during
and after the Revolution made the
retention of that fine historic name impossible.
During the Revolutionary War the
name of Fort Stanwix was changed to Fort
Schuyler; but that name, with all its
heritage of nobility and patriotism, was not
retained, and &ldquo;Fort&rdquo; Schuyler has been
dropped to make room for &ldquo;Fort&rdquo; Stanwix,
which is exceedingly contradictory. When
the deluge of classical names passed over
central New York&mdash;Utica, Manlius, Troy,
Syracuse, Rochester, etc.&mdash;that of Rome
was deposited here.</p>

<p>A square block in the center of Rome,
higher than the surrounding land, is the
site of Forts Stanwix and Schuyler. It is
covered with dwellings on all sides, but at
each of the corner bastions is planted a
cannon bearing a bronze tablet reading:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
&ldquo;A Fort which never surrendered. Defended
August 1777 by Col. Peter Ganseboort
&amp; Lieut. Col. Marinus Willett. Here
the Stars &amp; Stripes were first unfurled in
battle. Erected 1758.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The country about Rome is very level,
the declension in any direction being
slight; water from one field is said to
flow into the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and
into New York Bay. The explorer on the
Oneida portage will find it difficult to identify
the historic sites. The Erie canals
have completely drained the country, and
the last course is, in part, in the very bed
of Wood Creek&mdash;the stream to which the
portage from the Mohawk led. The nearest
point to Wood Creek is distant about
one mile from Rome; by the old route
it was crossed again two miles further
west. Of course the length of portage
between the Mohawk and Wood Creek
depended upon the stage of water in the
latter. The portage for canoes was probably
never more than the mile; in later
days, when Fort Oswego was erected and
supplies were sent thither by batteaux from
Albany, a three and even six-mile portage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
was necessary in order to reach water that
would float the heavy freight. At either
end of the three-mile portage stood Fort
Williams, on the Mohawk, and Fort Bull,
on Wood Creek. The longer portage was,
a little later, artificially shortened by damming
the waters of Wood Creek. By the
appended map it will be seen that in 1756
Fort Newport was being built at the end
of the one-mile portage. The explorer of
today will note in the western extremity
of Rome the old basin of Wood Creek where
the water was held back by dam and floodgate.
The end of this basin, near where
the road crosses Wood Creek, was the site
of old Fort Newport. On the ruins of Fort
Bull&mdash;which was destroyed in 1756 by a
French raid from Canada&mdash;was erected
Fort Wood Creek in 1758, distant, as the
map shows, three miles from Fort Newport.</p>

<p>Fort Stanwix, New Fort, Fort Williams,
Fort Newport, Fort Bull, and Fort Wood
Creek were all erected within twenty-five
years, and within three or four miles of
each other. Nothing could suggest more
plainly the strategic nature of this roadway
on the backbone of New York. Of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
all, the remains of Fort Wood Creek alone
are visible, save the embankment of Fort
Stanwix. Here, three miles out from
Rome, where the old portage path used to
run, beside the little creek now only a
shadow of the oldtime stream, is the interesting
star-shaped ruin of Fort Wood
Creek, surrounded by a moat still five feet
deep. The southern side, as the map
shows, (K), was not fortified strongly like
the others, as the water of the creek protected
it. The dam and floodgate were
just beyond the southwestern bastion and
the old embankment of the dam can still be
traced. The broad pond formed by the
dammed water is clearly visible in outline;
the present stream runs near the center of
it. It was probably seldom in the olden
days that the creek was not navigable here;
the dam doubtless made it so, for a large
part of the year, from Fort Newport downwards.
Yet the narrative just quoted
affirms that the portage was sometimes &ldquo;six
or eight miles across&rdquo; in unusually dry
seasons. This was certainly prior to the
erection of the dams and floodgates, which
&ldquo;saved so much land carriage&rdquo; according<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
to the map. In dry seasons, the map
assures us, the floodgates saved a portage
of seven miles to Canada Creek. This is
evidently the &ldquo;six or eight miles&rdquo; portage
mentioned by the narrative.</p>

<p>The British campaign of 1777 was a
spectacular event which covered the three
great valleys which converge from the
north, south, and west upon Albany. A
bird&rsquo;s-eye view of this campaign emphasizes
as it is almost impossible to do otherwise
the strategic value of portage paths.
From the north, Burgoyne comes up Lake
Champlain and Lake George and across the
portage to the Hudson, and starts down the
valley; to meet him, General Clinton leaves
New York and ascends the Hudson toward
Albany. From Oswego St. Leger starts
up the Onondaga (Oswego) River toward
the Oneida carrying place and Albany&mdash;where
the three armies are to form a union
for the final overthrow of the revolution.
St. Leger never got fairly over the Oneida
portage; he could not carry Fort Schuyler
which guarded it, and at Herkimer he was
completely routed. Burgoyne crossed
safely the portage to the Hudson, but had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
hardly done more when Gates was upon
him and Saratoga was the early turning
point of the war. To all intents and purposes
the great campaign was utterly
thwarted because the Americans successfully
held the strategic keys of the continent&mdash;the
Lake George-Hudson and the
Oneida carrying places.</p>

<h3>PORTAGES TO THE MISSISSIPPI BASIN</h3>


<p>The portage paths from the Great
Lakes, or streams entering them, to
the tributaries of the Mississippi
River were of great importance during the
era when that river was the goal of explorers,
conquerors and pioneers. So numerous
were they, it is only possible to describe
the most important briefly in this catalogue.
The greater are worthy, each, of an exhaustive
monograph, and even those of least
prominence were of importance far beyond
our ability to understand in these days.
Of them all only three routes have received
the attention they deserve; these are the
Lake Erie-Lake Chautauqua portage, the
Wabash route, and the St. Joseph-Kankakee
portage. Several other important portages
present as interesting fields of study, if not
more so, as these, and local historians
living near these paths will do well to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
interest themselves in them, map their
exact routes minutely, locate the old
springs, licks, forts, and traders&rsquo; cabins,
before all trace and recollection of them
is lost.</p>

<p>Passing westward from Niagara the first
explorers of the West found the shortest
route from the lakes to the Ohio was by a
portage from Chautauqua Creek to Chautauqua
Lake and from thence down the
Conewango to the Allegheny River.
Whether or not this was the most practicable
route it was, at first, of major importance.
The shortest route was all too long
for men on missions such as that of C&eacute;loron
bearing his leaden plates to the Ohio
Valley in 1749.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>There was, undoubtedly, an Indian
portage between Lake Erie and Lake
Chautauqua before C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s expedition,
but it would seem that now the first roadway
was built here. C&eacute;loron reached Niagara
River July 6, 1749. He departed on
the fifteenth, and &ldquo;on the 16th,&rdquo; wrote
Father Bonn&egrave;camps &ldquo;we arrived early at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the portage of Yjadakoin. It began at the
mouth of a little stream called Rivi&egrave;re aux
pommes [&ldquo;apple River&rdquo;],&mdash;the 3rd that
is met after entering the lake, and thus it
may be easily recognized.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>On the seventeenth the party began the
tedious portage and &ldquo;made a good league.&rdquo;
On the day following &ldquo;our people being
fatigued, we shortened the intervals
between the stations, and we hardly made
more than half a league ... the 22nd,
the portage was entirely accomplished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Six days were thus spent in crossing the
nine-mile path&mdash;a very good indication of
how difficult was the journey. And yet
Bonn&egrave;camps affirms &ldquo;The road is passably
good.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> This road was opened by a detachment
under Villiers and Le Borgne
sent out by C&eacute;loron on the sixteenth&mdash;&ldquo;nearly
three-quarters of a league of
road&rdquo; being cleared the first day.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>A detailed study of this path has been
made by Dr. H. C. Taylor of Brocton, New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
York.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> From him we quote the following
concerning the &ldquo;Old Portage Road,&rdquo; as
the path is known locally:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Its starting point was on the west side
of Chautauqua creek at Barcelona, within
a few rods of the lake. Its course from
this point was southerly along the bank of
the creek, passing the afterward location of
the first grist mill built in the county, by
John McMahon, not far from the mouth
of the creek, in 1804 or 1805, reached and
crossed the now main road at the ancient
cross roads, one mile west of the centre of
the village of Westfield, at the monument
erected there a few years since by Hon. E.
T. Foote (1870). From this point by a
south easterly course it soon reached the
steep bank of the creek Chautauqua, along
which it ran for a mile when it passed into
a deep gorge of a hundred feet or more in
depth, through which the creek ran, by an
extensive dugway still plainly to be seen
on the lands owned by Miss Elizabeth
Stone, where it crossed the creek and by
another dugway on lands for many years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
owned by Wm. Cummings, it reached the
high banks a few rods from the present
Glen Mills. The passage of this gorge was
a work of considerable magnitude. The
west bank was so very precipitous that the
passage of teams would seem nearly impossible,
yet it is said that in later years,
before the road on the east side of the creek
through the now village of Westfield was
opened, vast quantities of salt and merchandise
were transported over it from Lake
Erie to Lake Chautauqua for Pittsburgh
and other points in the Ohio Valley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the east side of the gorge the road
was less precipitous and is now a public
highway. After reaching a point above
Glen Mills on the south side of the gorge
through which the east branch of the Chautauqua
creek now runs, and where the
Mayville road is now located at that point,
to avoid the rugged section over the hill it
passed up the east branch for some distance
and continued to the east of the present
thoroughfare to Mayville, and reached
Chautauqua lake at or near the present
steamboat landing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By 1752&mdash;the year of Marin&rsquo;s expedition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
to the Ohio&mdash;the old road was well overgrown.
In the primeval forests it did not
take long for a road to become impassable
if unused. Braddock&rsquo;s Road over the
Alleghenies, cut in 1755, was impassable
in 1758. This road cut in 1749 was cut out
again in 1752.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In each case three years
had elapsed. Marin reached the portage
(Barcelona) in April 1752, but, warned
perhaps by C&eacute;loron, was unfavorably impressed
with the practicability of the route
and decided to push on and find another
portage to the Allegheny. Of this matter
we have the testimony of Stephen Coffin,
an eye-witness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They [Marin&rsquo;s vanguard] remained at
the fort [Niagara] 15 days, and then set
out by water, it being April, and arrived
at Chadakoin, on Lake Erie [Barcelona],
where they were ordered to fell timber and
prepare it for building a fort, according to
the Governor&rsquo;s instructions, but Mons.
Morang [Marin] coming up the next day
with 500 men and 20 Indians, put a stop to
the building of the fort, not liking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
situation, the river chadakoin [Chautauqua
Creek] being too shallow to carry out any
craft with provisions, etc, to Belle Riviere....
The two commanders had a
sharp debate, the first insisting on building
the fort there in accordance with the
instructions, but Morang gave him a writing
to satisfy the Governor on that point;
and then Mons. Mercier, who was commissary
and engineer was directed to go along
the lake and look for a situation, which he
found, and returned in a few days, it being
fifteen leagues to the southwest of chadakoin.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The portage chosen by Marin in preference
to this Chautauqua route was that from
Presque Isle (Erie, Pennsylvania) to Rivi&egrave;re
aux B&#339;ufs.</p>

<p>Marin did not accomplish the task of
fort-building for which he was sent in the
time prescribed, and his failure was attributed
by some to his choice of route to the
Allegheny. When returning to Niagara
late in the fall a detachment of French
from Presque Isle again landed at the Chau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>tauqua
portage. &ldquo;On the 30th (October)
they arrived,&rdquo; Coffin testified, &ldquo;at Chadakoin
where they stayed four days, during
which time Mons. Peon [Pean] with 200
men, cut a wagon road over the carrying
place from Lake Erie to Lake chadakoin,
viewed the situation which proved to their
liking, so set off Nov. 3d for Niagara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have one other glimpse of these impetuous
Frenchmen widening this first
portage path from the Great Lakes toward
the Ohio. Samuel Shattuck was born in
Deerfield, Massachusetts in 1741. In 1752
he went from his native town on a ranging
expedition and was at Fort Oswego when
Marin&rsquo;s party went down Lake Ontario.
An officer and five soldiers&mdash;one of whom
was this eleven-year-old lad&mdash;were instantly
sent out to watch the French
squadron of canoes. They followed them
to Niagara and into Lake Erie. An autobiographical
story has been taken down by
Dr. Taylor from the lips of Shattuck&rsquo;s
grandson. Soon after passing Niagara, the
story goes, the boats were lost to sight;
&ldquo;but we expected to overtake them easily,
and in fact did so sooner than was agree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>able
to us as we came near discovering
ourselves to the Indians that belonged to
the expedition scattered through the woods.
They had landed at the mouth of Chautauqua
creek, as now called, and were already
felling trees on the west side of the Creek,
apparently for some sort of fortification.
We were confident they had chosen this as
a carrying place to some waterway south
of the highlands.... From some cause
not apparent to us there was a cessation of
work, and after three or four days the
whole of both parties, with the exception
of a few Indians, embarked in their boats
and moved westward.&rdquo; Young Shattuck
went on with the party and remained near
Presque Isle spying on the French movements
until September, when his party
returned to Oswego. In October&mdash;such
was the anxiety of the English concerning
this fort and road-building&mdash;the same
scouts were sent back toward Presque Isle.
In the meantime, as before stated, the
French had started back for Niagara; landing
at the Chautauqua portage to make a
road. &ldquo;On the seventh day out [from
Oswego],&rdquo; reads Shattuck&rsquo;s autobiograph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>ical
story, &ldquo;or near October 30th, as near
as I remember, in the afternoon we came
upon a party of nearly or quite a hundred
Frenchmen rolling logs into a ravine in the
bottom of a deep gulf, and digging into the
steep sides of the gulf for a road, apparently,
at a point that I now (1826) know to
have been on the south border of the village
of Westfield.... We came upon this
party very suddenly and unexpectedly, for
we had supposed that the whole matter of a
carrying place had been transferred to
Erie.... As it was we escaped and
witnessed the completion of the road from
Lake Erie to Lake Chautauqua. on the third
or fourth day the whole party embarked in
their boats and moved eastward.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Passing west of Presque Isle, the first
stream offering another passage way to the
Ohio was the Cuyahoga River. Ascending
this stream about twenty-five miles, an
eight-mile portage, almost within the city
limits of Akron, Ohio, offered the traveler
a passage way to the Tuscarawas branch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the Muskingum River, which in turn offered
a clear course to the Ohio at Marietta.</p>

<p>This portage is not of more than purely
local interest save only that it was the first
western boundary of territory west of the
Ohio to be secured by the United States
from the Indians. The treaties of Fort
McIntosh, Fort Harmar and Greenville
designate this portage as the western boundary
line between white and red men.
The path was surveyed in July 1797&mdash;one
year after the arrival of the Connecticut
pioneers in the Western Reserve&mdash;by
Moses Warren Jr. Its total length was
given as eight miles, four chains, and fifty-five
links.</p>

<p>The path was, undoubtedly, of great
importance in the earliest days. This
route, if the rivers were passable, was certainly
the most practicable of all routes
from Lake Erie to the lower Ohio. The
portage was comparatively easy and the
Muskingum was a swift, clear river. The
Cuyahoga was probably almost impassable
except at floodtide. The Connecticut
pioneers found it so in 1796. Pioneer settlers
on the upper Tuscarawas received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
much of their merchandise from the east
by way of Buffalo and the Cuyahoga-Tuscarawas
portage.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Scioto and Miami rivers were not as
large as the Muskingum but were easily
plied at most seasons by the light canoe.
The Sandusky and Auglaize (emptying
into the Maumee) offered a waterway
which, with portages, took the traveler from
Lake Erie to the Ohio by these routes.
That they were uncertain and difficult
courses is shown by the records of Croghan
and Bonn&eacute;camps.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The spot of ground at the head of the
Great Miami (from the source of Loramie
Creek to the head of the St. Mary and Auglaize)
was a more important point than one
would believe without considerable investigation.
Looking at the matter from the
olden view-point it seems that this was one
of the strategic points in the West in the
canoe age. Here on Loramie Creek three
routes focused&mdash;those of the St. Mary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Auglaize, and Miami rivers. Here, near
the mouth of Loramie Creek, English traders
erected a trading station almost contemporaneous
with C&eacute;loron&rsquo;s journey; from
their point of vantage the French drove
them away, and here the earliest French
store was built. This stood near the mouth
of the creek in Miami County (Ohio) while
sixteen miles up the creek at the beginning
of the shortest portage was the location of
famed Loramie&rsquo;s Store of later date and
known to half a continent for half a century.
The carrying place across to Girty&rsquo;s town
(George not Simon Girty) was five miles to
what is now St. Marys, Shelby County on
the St. Mary River. Toward this point
Harmar and Wayne both struck in 1790
and 1794, Wayne building Fort Loramie
at that end of the portage path mentioned.
A stone raised near the mouth
of Loramie Creek was one of the corner
stones of the old Indian treaty line
mentioned in the treaties of Fort Stanwix
(1784), Fort McIntosh (1786), Fort Harmar
(1789) and Greenville (1795). Loramie
Creek was known thereby as the &ldquo;Standing
Stone fork of the Great Miami.&rdquo; One of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the remarkable features of the Loramie
portage was the deadened trees to be seen
here&mdash;indicative of busy canoe-building.</p>

<p>At the head of the Maumee&mdash;the &ldquo;Miami
river of Lake Erie&rdquo;&mdash;a portage path led
to the Wabash. It began on the left bank
of the St. Mary River, a short distance
above its junction with the St. Joseph, and
ran eight miles to Little River, the first
branch of the Wabash. This route from
the Lakes to the Mississippi, at first of least
importance, became finally the most important
of the five great French passage
ways southwest. It was discovered to be
the shortest route from the capital of New
France to the Mississippi and Illinois settlements
and has been appropriately called
&ldquo;the Indian Appian Way.&rdquo; The importance
of this route in the history of the
Old Northwest has been effectively presented
by Elbert Jay Benton.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The voyager&rsquo;s canoes followed the Ottawa
river from Montreal, then by portage to
Lake Nipissing, and to Georgian bay, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
eastern arm of Lake Huron, and thence by
the northern lakes to Green bay, the Fox,
and by portage to the Wisconsin and Mississippi
rivers. It was the most natural
route because in every way it was the line
of least resistance. It avoided the near
approaches to the Iroquois Indian limits
and led directly to the numerous Indian
haunts around the greater lakes. As the
objective point for the westward expeditions
was gradually moved farther south
into the Mississippi basin, shorter routes
across the territory, later known as the Old
Northwest, were used. The Wisconsin
portage soon yielded in point of frequency
of use to those at the South end of Lake
Michigan. The route up the Illinois river
and by portage into the Chicago river and
Lake Michigan was followed by Joliet and
Marquette on their return from the discovery
of the Mississippi. A few years later
La Salle followed the coast of Lake Michigan
to the St. Joseph river and up that
stream, thence by a portage to the Kankakee,
and so again to the usual destination&mdash;points
on the Illinois and the Mississippi.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About this time, in the course of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
evolution of new routes leading to the
Mississippi, occurred the first use of
the Wabash river by white explorers.
This stream was occasionally reached in
the earliest period by leaving Lake Michigan
on the St. Joseph river and then
by a short portage to the headwaters of
a northern branch of the Wabash, but
the more important way to reach it was by
the &lsquo;Miami river of Lake Erie&rsquo; and a short
portage. Of the five great portage routes,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
this was the last one to come into general
use by the whites.... Many have tried
to trace La Salle&rsquo;s voyage of 1670 by the
Wabash river. Joliet&rsquo;s map of 1674, which
locates La Salle&rsquo;s route by way of Lake
Erie and the Wabash, has been used in
support of this contention. But the route
laid down is clearly a later interpolation
and adds nothing directly to the argument.
It is, however, most significant that within
a few years La Salle had become in some
manner fully aware of this Wabash route
and the advantages it offered. During the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
years that he was in command at Ft. Frontenac,
he appears to have been evolving
great schemes for appeasing the Iroquois
and for opening up an easy channel of
trade to the Mississippi Valley by the Maumee
and Wabash; but by 1682 he seems to
have temporarily abandoned this plan,
&lsquo;because,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I could no longer go
to the Illinois but by the Lakes Huron and
Illinois, as the other routes which I have
discovered by the head of Lake Erie and
by the southern coast of the same, have
become too dangerous by frequent encounters
with the Iroquois who are always on
that shore.&rsquo; La Salle&rsquo;s description of the
territory between Lake Erie and Lake
Michigan indicates a familiarity with this
region scarcely possible save from personal
observation. In a letter written November
9, 1680, he says, &lsquo;There is at the end of
Lake Erie ten leagues below the strait a
river by which we could shorten the route
to the Illinois very much. It is navigable
to canoes to within two leagues of the route
now in use.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> ... his [La Salle&rsquo;s] repre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>sentations
were the first to direct the attention
of the French to the regions south and
west of Lake Erie.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the most historic campaign in
which the Wabash route played a part was
Hamilton&rsquo;s journey across it in 1778 when
he went to the recapture of Vincennes.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
From the standpoint of this present study
this campaign is of particular interest, as
it was one of the exceedingly few instances
in which a military movement was made
by water on the lesser rivers of the West.
It is remarkable that though the two important
posts west of the Alleghenies, Detroit
and Pittsburg, were through many years,
in the possession of bitter enemies, neither
one ever conquered or hardly attempted to
conquer the other. A hundred plans for
the capture of Detroit were conceived in
Fort Pitt, and many a commander of Fort
Detroit was determined to subdue Fort
Pitt.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Yet it can almost be said that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
nothing of the kind was ever actually
attempted, unless McIntosh&rsquo;s campaign
be considered such an attempt. This
was because the journey between them
could be accomplished only by a long,
tedious land march over the Great Trail,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
or by a desperate journey over small inland
streams and the portages between them.
Difficult as the land journey over the Indian
trail would seem, it is clear that it was considered
preferable to any water route in
Revolutionary days.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Thus Hamilton&rsquo;s campaign over the
Wabash route upon Vincennes was an
exceptional feat, successfully accomplished
after great hardships and delays. Clark&rsquo;s
marvelously intrepid recapture of this fort
by wading through the drowned lands of
the Wabash has so far eclipsed all other
events of that campaign that the heroism
of other actors has been forgotten.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>On October 28, 1778,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Hamilton left the
Miamis&rsquo; town, where he held conferences
with the Indians, and proceeded to Pied-froid,
on the other side of the river St.
Joseph.</p>

<p>The day following the gun-boat was
placed on the carriage with great difficulty.
Two officers were left to forward the boats
from the portage, and Hamilton walked to
the further end of the carrying place, three
leagues, where the provisions were collected.
He ordered two officers with the
six-pounder and ammunition to go down
to carry in pirogues. &ldquo;This carry is one
of the sources of the Wabash,&rdquo; Hamilton
wrote in his <i>Journal</i>, &ldquo;and takes its rise
on the level plain, which is a height of
land near the Miamis town. The carry is
called &lsquo;petite rivi&egrave;re.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Where the
pirogues were first launched, it is only wide
enough for one boat, and is much embarrassed
with logs and stumps. About four
miles below is a beaver dam,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and to these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
animals the traders are indebted for the
conveniency of bringing their peltry by
water from the Indian posts on the waters
of the Ouabache.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> On my return met
Lieut. Du Vernet with seven pirogues
loaded. Ordered him to proceed and join
Lieut. St. Cosme, who was below the dam
with some men employed to clear the chemin
couvert, the narrow part of the carry,
so narrow and embarrassed with logs under
water and boughs overhead that it required
a great deal of work to make it passable for
our small craft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On October 30, Hamilton sent Lieutenant
De Quindre with seven pirogues loaded
with provisions, and fourteen men, to follow
Lieut. Du Vernet. In the evening he
went to the dam which had been cut there
to give a passage for the pirogues; and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
sinking a batteau in the gap, and stopping
the water with sods and paddles, he raised
the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay in the wood this night. Wolves
very numerous hereabout.</p>

<p>October 31. Returned to the camp at
the Portage.</p>

<p>November 1. Left landing with seven
batteaus and three pirogues loaded with
provisions, and proceeded to the dam,
which we opened and yet found the water
so scanty that it was with the greatest difficulty
we passed the chemin couvert. At
the end of this narrow pass came to the
swamp called les Volets, from the water
lilies in it.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The batteaus frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
rested on the mud, and we labored hard up
to the knees in mud and entangled among
the roots and rotten stumps of trees. At
length got to the channel formed by the
meeting of the Petite Rivi&egrave;re and the
Rivi&egrave;re a Bo&ecirc;te.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Here we encamped,
having got but ten miles with great fatigue.</p>

<p>November 2. Small party sent down
the river to clear away the logs, etc. The
rest of the men employed in damming the
water of the two little rivers, to provide
for our passage downwards. Heard from
Lieut. Du Vernet below that we could not
proceed from the shallowness of the water.</p>

<p>November 3. Work on the dam continued.
A light canoe sent to the landing
for workmen and tools, which returned at
half past twelve at night.</p>

<p>November 4. Water was raised three
feet. At 8 P. M. Major Hay arrived with
the remainder of the boats, provisions, etc.</p>

<p>November 6. Major Hay proceeded down
the river, the water being let off, and made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
another dam a mile below Rivi&egrave;re &agrave;
l&rsquo;Anglais.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>November 7th. Broke up the dam and
proceeded to the pays plat, where the bed
of the river being very broad with almost
continuous ledges of rock and large stones,
found great difficulty. Men in the water
from 10 A. M. till after sunset, at which
time only one batteau had got to the foot
of the rifts (Petit Rocher). Most of the
boats damaged.</p>

<p>November 8. Continued to work in the
water to forward the boats. Sent down to
Du Vernet, who was encamped at the fork
of the Ouabache, for seven light pirogues
and twenty-two men to assist in lightening
the boats.</p>

<p>November 9. Set off from Petit Rocher.
Arrived at the forks of the Ouabache at 3
P. M.</p>

<p>November 10. Repairing the boats and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
airing the bales which had got wet. Sent
back to Petit Rocher for the provisions,
which had been left there to lighten the
boats. After this the river began to rise
on account of the heavy rains, and snow
and cold weather also came on, which
increased the difficulties of the journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the returns of Henry Du Vernet,
second Lieutenant of Artillery, the number
of perogues used by Hamilton was forty-two,
and of batteaux (&ldquo;and a very large
French one&rdquo;), ten. Ten two-wheeled carts
were employed at the portage, two carriages
&ldquo;with 4 wheels for the Batteaus,&rdquo;
and four &ldquo;with 2 wheels for the peroques.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The St. Joseph River, emptying into
Lake Michigan, was one of the earlier
important roundabout routes to the Mississippi.
The eastern fork headed with the
Wabash, and with a short portage was the
route La Salle described as being &ldquo;within
two leagues&rdquo; of the Miami of Lake Erie.
This St. Joseph-Wabash portage was extremely
important, but was roundabout,
and was probably abandoned at a comparatively
early date.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>The southern branch of the St. Joseph
heads near the northwest branch of the
Kankakee, a tributary of the Illinois, near
South Bend, Indiana. This historic path
has been made the subject of a monograph
by Secretary George A. Baker of the Northern
Indiana Historical Society.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The seal
of this Society is appropriately inscribed:
&ldquo;This region before the advent of the
white man was occupied by the Miamis and
Pottawatomies. It was made historic by
the early explorers and missionaries who
used the Kankakee-St. Joseph River Portage.&rdquo;
A few of Mr. Baker&rsquo;s paragraphs
should be included in this catalogue:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shortly after Easter Sunday, 1675, the
sick and disheartened priest, Father Jacques
Marquette, left the Indian village of Kaskaskia
to return to his beloved St. Ignace
by a new route, which many eminent
authorities believe to have been via the
Kankakee River. In that case it is very
probable that he and his two faithful attendants,
Pierre Porteret and Jacques, made
use of the portage between the Kankakee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
and St. Joseph Rivers&mdash;a carrying place
of between four and five miles. The portage
landing on the St. Joseph River is two
and three-quarters miles northwest of the
court house, at South Bend, St. Joseph
County, Indiana, and the portage extends
in a southwesterly course to three small
ponds which were the nearest sources of
the Kankakee. The basins of these ponds
are still clearly defined.... The earliest
mention of this historic route is found in
the writings of Father Louis Hennepin,
Henry de Tonty and R&eacute;n&eacute; Robert Cavelier,
Sieur de La Salle, who first made use of
it ... in December, 1679. We are led
to believe, however, that Louis Jolliet,
companion of Marquette and co-discoverer
of the Mississippi, knew of this portage as
early as 1673.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The portage landing ... is just to
the east of the big red barn, on the Miller
property, south of the residence, and at the
foot of a beautiful ravine declining gently
from the high ground. At the water&rsquo;s
edge, stretching back at least one hundred
feet, is a low sandy terrace of recent formation.
The approach to this picturesque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
ravine is obscure and hard to locate from
the river; the view being obstructed by the
forest trees. Many of the original trees
are still standing ... many red-cedars,
the latter evidently being the progeny of a
grand old cedar, a stately monarch of the
portage landing, which reaches to the
height of over sixty feet, with a girth of
more than eight feet at its base.... The
trunk ... has been covered by the sand
and soil washed from above, to a depth of
between seven and eight feet.... Recently,
June, 1897, the soil around the old
cedar was removed and the measurements
as stated were made. As the trunk was
laid bare ... three great blaze-marks
[were found], forming a rude cross, made by
a wide-bladed axe, such as were in common
use in the French colonies. Here was
what we had suspected, one of the witness
trees marked no doubt in early days to
locate the portage.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Fort St. Joseph was located on the opposite
side of the river from a Pottawatomie
village, which was on the portage trail.
The location of this fort and Indian settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ment
is never unanimously estimated to
have been less than about sixty miles from
the mouth of the St. Joseph River; Father
Marest wrote Father German from &ldquo;Cascaskias&rdquo;
November 9, 1712: &ldquo;... we
ascended the river Saint Joseph, in order
to make a portage at 30 [20?] leagues from
its mouth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>This important route from Illinois to
Detroit was first fortified by the building
of the earliest &ldquo;Fort Miami,&rdquo; near the
mouth of the St. Josephs of Lake Michigan,
by La Salle in 1679. &ldquo;But this fort,&rdquo; Mr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites writes, &ldquo;was destroyed
by La Salle&rsquo;s men in 1680. Father
Jean Mermet, then at the river [St. Joseph]
mouth, writes La Mathe Cadillac, April 19,
1702, that he proposes to establish a mission
&lsquo;three journeys,&rsquo; or about sixty miles up
river, &lsquo;near a stream [Illinois] which is the
source of the Ouabache,&rsquo; where there is
a portage of half a league (<i>Margry</i>, v, p.
219). In 1711, Father Chardon had his
mission sixty miles above the mouth. By
1712, there appears to have been a French<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
military post at this mission. Charlevoix,
in a letter dated &lsquo;River St. Joseph, Aug.
16, 1721,&rsquo; writes, describing his approach
to the fort from Lake Michigan: &lsquo;You
afterward sail up twenty leagues in it [up
the St. Josephs River] before you reach the
fort, which navigation requires great precaution.&rsquo;...
The evidence is ample,
that the fort on the St. Josephs, from about
1712 to its final destruction during the
Revolutionary war, guarded the portage
between the river of that name and the
Kankakee, on the east bank of the St.
Josephs, in Indiana, a short distance below
the present city of South Bend.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>The Kankakee-St. Joseph route was a
favorite one for travelers returning from
Illinois to the Great Lakes and Canada.
The favorite early &ldquo;outward&rdquo; route was
from the western shore of Lake Michigan
into the Illinois River. Here were two
courses: by way of either the Calumet or
the Chicago River to the Des Plaines branch
of the Illinois. The latter portage was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
best known and most used. Perhaps no
one of the western portages varied more
than this in length, as on the best authority
it is asserted that sometimes no portage
was necessary, and at others a portage of
nine miles was necessary: &ldquo;The Chicago&mdash;Des
Plaines route involved a &lsquo;carry&rsquo; of
from four to nine miles, according to the
season of the year; in a rainy spring season,
it might not be over a mile; and
during a freshet, a canoe might be paddled
over the entire route, without any portage.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
When Marquette reached the Des
Plaines, known as &ldquo;Portage River&rdquo; because
it offered a pathway to the Illinois, he was
compelled to make a portage of only &ldquo;half
a league.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The course of this portage is
practically the present route of the famous
Drainage Canal which joins the Chicago
River with the Des Plaines at Elgin, Illinois.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most westernly portage from the
Great Lakes to the Mississippi was of the
greatest importance in the earliest years of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
white man&rsquo;s exploration. The French
were the first explorers, and they were at
first barred from Lakes Ontario and Erie&mdash;which
offered the shortest courses to the
Mississippi, via the Ohio&mdash;by the ferocious
Iroquois; whose hostility Champlain had
quickly incurred, toward himself and his
people. Driven around, as has been
shown,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> by way of the Ottawa to Georgian
Bay, the longest route to the Mississippi
became one of the shortest. From Georgian
Bay it is a straight course to Green Bay,
and so the portage between the Fox and
the Wisconsin Rivers became one of the
earliest as well as one of the most important
in America. By this route the discoverers
of the Mississippi were destined to come&mdash;for
there were many who found and lost
this river. First in the line came Radissou
and Groseilliers, at the end of that fifth
shadowy decade of the seventeenth century.
These daring men, possessed of the desire
&ldquo;to travell and see countreys&rdquo; and &ldquo;to be
knowne w<sup>th</sup> the remotest people,&rdquo; found
the Fox-Wisconsin portage and passed
down the Wisconsin to the Mississippi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
probably in the spring or early summer of
1659<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>&mdash;arriving on that river eleven years
before La Salle, and fourteen years before
Joliet and Marquette, to whom the discovery
of the Mississippi is usually ascribed.</p>

<p>But though these men passed over this
route to the discovery of the Mississippi,
they were not the first white men to traverse
it. Jean Nicolet, the first of Europeans,
came over this course in 1634, but
did not descend the Wisconsin.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Two score years later the bold missionaries,
Joliet and Marquette, entered the
Fox River and came to Maskoutens, &ldquo;the
fire Nation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; wrote Marquette,
&ldquo;is the limit of the discoveries which the
french have made, for they have not yet
gone any farther.&rdquo; Of Radissou and
Groseilliers no memory was left among the
savages, and of them Marquette had never
heard. &ldquo;No sooner had we arrived,&rdquo; Marquette
wrote in his <i>Journal</i>, &ldquo;than we, Monsieur
Jollyet and I assembled the elders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
together; and he told them that he was
sent by Monsieur Our Governor to discover
New countries, while I was sent by God to
Illumine them with the light of the holy
Gospel. He told them that, moreover, the
sovereign Master of our lives wished to be
known by all the Nations; and that in
obeying his will I feared not the death to
which I exposed myself in voyages so
perilous. He informed them that we needed
two guides to show us the way; and We
gave them a present, by it asking them to
grant us the guides. To this they very
Civilly consented; and they also spoke to
us by means of a present, consisting of a
Mat to serve us as a bed during the whole
of our voyage. On the following day, the
tenth of June two Miamis who were given
us as guides embarked with us.... We
knew that, at three leagues from Maskoutens,
was a River which discharged into Mississippi.
We knew also that the direction we
were to follow in order to reach it was
west-southwesterly. But the road is broken
by so many swamps and small lakes that it
is easy to lose one&rsquo;s way, especially as the
River leading thither is so full of wild oats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
that it is difficult to find the Channel. For
this reason we greatly needed our two
guides, who safely Conducted us to a portage
of 2,700 paces, and helped us to transport
our Canoes to enter That river; ...
Thus we left the Waters flowing to Quebeq,
4 or 500 Leagues from here, to float on Those
that would thenceforward Take us through
strange lands.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>By the feet of such undaunted heroes the
Fox-Wisconsin portage path was made
hallowed ground. But the importance of
this route, in the days when Georgian Bay
was the entering point of the French into
the Great Lakes, did not rapidly diminish;
through all pioneer history, when Mackinac
and Detroit were the key of the Lakes, this
route to the Mississippi was important.
For instance, in the fur trade of the West
and of Wisconsin in particular, this portage
was of utmost moment.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> In the preceding
pages this matter of the fur trade on portages
has not been sufficiently suggested;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
it is, however, a subject on which important
and exhaustive histories should be
written. The portages were, in numerous
instances, the keys of the fur trade.</p>

<p>In the Revolutionary War, the Fox-Wisconsin
portage bore a more or less important
part in British plans of gaining the
alliance of the Indians of the upper Mississippi
Basin.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The awakening in the
Northwest is evidenced by the increasing
importance of this pathway in the War of
1812.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> This was the route of British trade
with the Mississippi Indians until the very
last.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The commercial and economic
history of this route, the establishment of
Fort Winnebago, the question of government
ownership of land, the improvement
of the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers, the
Military Road across the portage, the days
of the Durhams boats, and the building of
the canal make this route more interesting
than any other west of Niagara.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be a serious omission not to
include in this catalogue at least a mention
of the portages which completed the line of
communication along the chain of the Great
Lakes&mdash;or from the St. Lawrence across
to the extremity of Lake Superior. The
importance of the portage from the Ottawa
to Lake Nipissing and French River has
been fully suggested, in our emphasis of
the use of the Ottawa route, by which the
French avoided the Iroquois and gained the
western lakes. The historic and economic
phase of the Niagara River offers a magnificent
untouched field for historic study.
The series of forts and their varying
flags which defended this key of the
Lakes; the struggle for their possession;
the portage routes here that were of such
vital importance to all the West; the earliest
systems of transportation around
Niagara Falls; the supplementary roundabout
routes, such as up Grand River; and
finally, the building of the Welland Canal,
offer a splendid topic for study and field
work. At the extremity of Lake Superior
was the Grand Portage, which joined the
Great Lakes with Hudson Bay, by way of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Pigeon River and the Lake of the Woods.
It was first found by Radissou and Groseilliers
in 1662, fortified in 1737, and at the
beginning of the nineteenth century was
&ldquo;the Headquarters or General Rendezvous,
for all who trade in this part of the
world.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>In concluding this review of portage
paths the author finds a final opportunity
to offer a plea for the wide study of historic
sites and for placing there monuments of
some kind for the purposes of identification
before it be all too late.</p>

<p>We cannot realize in the slightest degree
the great interest that will be felt in our
historical beginnings one, two, and three
centuries from now, as our nation grows
richer and hundreds give themselves up to
the study of the past where ten can do so
today. It is fair to believe that we cannot
realize how precious every relic and every
accurate piece of information&mdash;every monument
and tablet&mdash;will seem when at last the
days of Braddock and Johnson, Washington and
Clark and Wayne are lost in three
hundred years of change and evolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Therefore we cannot fully realize the precious
duty that falls upon the present
generation&mdash;and upon us particularly.</p>

<p>The reason is evident: within a generation
there will not be left in our land
a single son of one of the genuine pioneers
of, for instance, New York or
Ohio. Even those of the second generation
remember with really little distinctness
and accuracy the days of which
their fathers told; often their stories
are entirely unreliable. This very fact is
in itself alarming, and is it not then the
duty of all interested persons to secure
immediately every item of information from
such of that second generation as are found
to be accurate and clear? In every State
there are a hundred historic sites for which,
in time, people generally will be inquiring.
We speak easily of Fort Necessity and Fort
Bull and Fort Laurens&mdash;but where are
they? The sites of these historic embankments
are known today, but of the New
York and Pennsylvania sites doubts are
beginning to pass current. The location of
Fort Laurens&mdash;the first American fort built
west of the Ohio River&mdash;is pretty definitely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
known. It is fair to say that in a generation
or two the spots, if left unmarked, will
never be located correctly. A small stone,
with a plain legend, costing a mere trifle,
would insure the future against such a
misfortune.</p>

<p>The subject of portage paths naturally
suggests the matter of locating historic sites
and marking them for the reason that so
many such points were on these portages.
A mere catalogue of the forts mentioned in
preceding pages prove this conclusively.
Add to these the mission houses, trading
stations and treaty houses here erected and
we have a sum total of vitally important
historic sites which could be equalled only
by looking to the river valleys. And very
frequently indeed the real significance of
many a fort at a river&rsquo;s mouth lay in the
fact that at that river&rsquo;s head lay a strategic
carrying place. What else did Fort Defiance,
Fort Venango, Fort Oswego, Fort
Niagara, Fort Miami on the St. Joseph
mean?</p>

<p>These portage routes should be presented
to all local and State historical societies as
important fields of study in the very im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>mediate
present if the many historic sites
here are to be correctly marked. They are
easy fields of investigation because as a rule
a great amount of geographic lore is treasured
up in a small compass; many a portage,
like the Oneida portage at Rome, New
York, was not over a mile in length; yet
here are the sites of at least half a dozen
forts, some of them of world-wide renown.
Take the famous portage at Fort Wayne,
Indiana, from the Maumee (St. Mary) to
the Wabash (Little River); the field here is
of great importance yet the ground to be
covered is exceedingly limited. A few
dollars invested in slight monuments could
now establish markers along this route
with some degree of accuracy and conscientious
satisfaction. Later on this will not
be possible. Each year lessens the probability
of accuracy, takes from the neighborhood
one and another of the aged men who
would be of assistance, changes more and
more the face of the landscape&mdash;in short
tends to rob all future students of something
of real value that we might confer
upon them.</p>

<p>It may be due to a lack of antiquarian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
enthusiasm on the part of the present
writer, but he is strongly of the opinion
that our historical societies are losing an
invaluable amount of information and data
by not seizing the advantage of the advice
of pioneers&rsquo; sons who are now living concerning
the location of historic sites; not a
little money is being expended here and
there on arch&aelig;ological research which
would produce exactly as fruitful returns a
generation from now as it does today. The
stone pipes and hammers will be found in
as good condition in 1925 as 1903 but there
are a hundred important sites that can
never be marked correctly after a score of
men now over seventy years of age have
passed away. At a recent centennial celebration
on the site of one of the most important
forts in the entire West the old fortress
was reconstructed with life-like accuracy
under scholarly direction. It was necessary,
however, because of inundations of
the neighboring river, to draw in one of
the bastions. It will not be many years
before the entire topography of that site
will be altered by the same destructive
force, unless it is stayed, and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
second centennial of the day when Mad
Anthony Wayne unfurled his flag in the
face of the British from the walls of Fort
Defiance is celebrated, there is a question
whether the site of that fort will be above
or below the river&rsquo;s tide.</p>

<p>A pig-sty at Fort Recovery, Ohio, marks
the Fort Recovery angle of the famous
Greenville Treaty line. Underneath the
pen lies the stone which marks the angle
and the site of that historic fort and, consequently,
St. Clair&rsquo;s battle-ground. The
line runs twenty-one miles westward to the
pillar raised on Loramie Creek, the historic
site of the old French trading post in 40&deg;
16&acute; north latitude 7&deg; 15&acute;&acute; west longitude; at
the other angle on the Muskingum River
the site of Fort Laurens is also a matter of
record. In this way, it is true, many
points of interest have a definite location but
this is true in only a few cases. The
writer, recently returning from a tour
through Illinois on George Rogers Clark&rsquo;s
old route to the conquest of Vincennes took
his notes at once to Madison, Wisconsin to
revise them from the correspondence carried
on by Lyman C. Draper, a generation ago,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
with the oldest residents of Illinois concerning
Clark&rsquo;s route. The remarkable contrast
between testimony obtainable now and that
secured a generation ago could not have
been more strikingly impressive. Indecision,
indefiniteness, inaccuracy grow more
and more pronounced as the days draw by
and an actual experience such as this compels
one interested in our country&rsquo;s development
to cry out against permitting more
time to be lost.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has set a good example in
forwarding a minute study of her frontier
forts, two large volumes having been published
by that state on the subject. There
are signs that there is an awakening interest
in definitely locating and marking historic
sites. It need not be an expensive work.
It is certainly an important one. And the
courses of the important carrying places
should be early considered.</p>

&ldquo;Camp at Petite Riviere,&rdquo; concerning the portage path
from the Maumee to Little River, as follows: &ldquo;This
carrying place is free from any obstructions, but what
the carelessness &amp; ignorance of the French have left, &amp;
would leave from Generation to Generation. An intelligent
person at a small expense might make it as fine a
road as any within 20 miles of London. The Woods are
beautiful, Oak, Ash, Beech, Nutwood, very clear &amp; of
a great growth ... in a ridge near the road I found
a sea fossil, to find Marine productions on this hauteur
des terres is to my mind more curious than their being
found in the Alps&mdash;there are no mountains in view
from Detroit to this place so that these appearances
cannot readily be accounted for from volcanoes of which
there is no trace to be observed.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Wisconsin Historical
Collections</i>, vol. xi, p. 179.</p></div>
